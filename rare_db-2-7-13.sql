The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/">3.4</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool. 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead. We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/">iOS</a>, <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">Android</a>, <a href="http://blackberry.wordpress.org/">Blackberry</a>, <a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="http://nokia.wordpress.org/">Nokia</a>, and <a href="http://webos.wordpress.org/">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic  updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">core</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">theme review</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/support/">forum support</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/updates/">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href="http://sopastrike.com/numbers/">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans.

Media has long been a friction point and we&#8217;ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system. 3.5 includes a new default theme, Twenty Twelve, which has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site. Finally we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time refreshing the styles of the dashboard, updating everything to be Retina-ready with beautiful high resolution graphics, a new color picker, and streamlining a couple of fewer-used sections of the admin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything you can share with your friends:</p>\n<div id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=jQDfEbzZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="692" height="388" title="Introducing WordPress 3.5" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can now put your (or anyone&#8217;s) WordPress.org username on the plugins page and see your favorite tagged ones, to make it easy to install them again when setting up a new site. There&#8217;s a new Tumblr importer. New installs no longer show the links manager. Finally for multisite developers <code>switch_to_blog()</code> is way faster and you can now install MS in a sub-directory. The <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> JavaScript libraries are now available. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features above and beyond this</a>, and you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.5">grab a warm beverage and explore Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<h3>Percussion Section</h3>\n<p>Behind every great release is great contributors. 3.5 had more people involved than any release before it:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

(Chances are, it wasn&#8217;t intentional.) And despite all of the changes to media, we&#8217;re still aiming to be backwards compatible with plugins that make changes to the existing media library.

SimplePie <del>1.3</del> 1.3.1. jQuery <del>1.8.2</del> 1.8.3. jQuery UI <del>1.9 (and it&#8217;s not even released yet)</del> 1.9.2. We&#8217;ve also added Backbone 0.9.2 and Underscore <del>1.3.3</del> 1.4.2, and you can use protocol-relative links when enqueueing scripts and styles. (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16560">#16560</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>WP Query:</strong> You can now ask to receive posts in the order specified by <code>post__in</code>. (<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13729">#13729</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>XML-RPC:</strong> New user management, profile editing, and post revision methods.

Also: You can now use multisite in a subdirectory, and uploaded files no longer go through ms-files (for new installs).

(<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21812">#21812</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Posts API: </strong>Major performance improvements when working with hierarchies of pages and post ancestors.

Jay has been a consultant to the Maine Department of Education for the past 2 years, during which time, he proposed, built, and is continuously improving <a href="http://MaineLearning.net">MaineLearning.net</a>, a professional collaboration community and learning resource directory for Maine educators.</em></p>\n<p><em>MaineLearning.net is built on WordPress and BuddyPress, using a highly-curated set of plugins and themes. In the following report, Jay outlines Maine’s use of BuddyPress as part of its continuing innovations in K-12 education.</em><span id="more-22586"></span></p>\n<h2>Strategic context</h2>\n<p>The <a href="http://maine.gov/">state of Maine</a> has been an innovator in <a href="http://www.maine.gov/mlti/index.shtml">digital learning</a> for over 15 years.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href="http://www.msln.net/">Maine School and Library&nbsp;Network</a>, initiated in 1996, provides Internet access to all&nbsp;schools and libraries&nbsp;in Maine.</li>\n<li>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maine.gov/mlte/">one-to-one laptop program</a>, established by law in 2001, provides laptops to every 7th and 8th grader in the state, while school districts fund laptops for an additional 50% of high school students.</li>\n<li>A high-speed <a href="http://www.mainefiberco.com/">network backbone</a>, bringing gigabit ethernet to rural communities, was completed in 2012. The goal was to provide inexpensive connectivity to last-mile providers: for-profit corporations, not-for-profit organizations, cooperatives, and municipalities.</li>\n<li>In 2012, Maine passed legislation for <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/news/maine-switchdiploma-based-on-proficiency_2012-04-10.html">proficiency-based high school diplomas</a>. Starting in 2017, rather than receiving passing grades in a standardized series of courses in order to graduate, many high school&nbsp;students will be able to receive a diploma by demonstrating proficiency in a variety of ways, from traditional tests to portfolios, performance, exhibitions and projects … and at their own pace. Schools will be allowed to eliminate age-based classes altogether.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/collier/innovations-in-maine-education">And more</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Online community of practice</h2>\n<p>To support this transition to learner-centered and proficiency-based learning, commissioner&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maine.gov/education/commissioner">Stephen Bowen</a>&nbsp;charged the Department of Education with developing an&nbsp;<a href="http://jaycollier.net/strategy/collaboration/discovery/">online community of practice</a>&nbsp;(OCOP) “where teachers, school leaders, curriculum coordinators and others can share best practices – lesson plans, rubrics, curriculum materials and professional development opportunities.” The charge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p lang="en-US">Build a professional learning community platform to help educators engage in conversation, share innovative ideas, discover and curate useful resources, document successful practices, and apply them in their own classrooms and schools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang="en-US">Support and sustain continuity between in-person meetings and professional development opportunities. Help new constituents get up to speed and become valuable, active partners in learning communities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang="en-US">Model an interdisciplinary, continuous-learning community approach that can be implemented at schools and districts across the state.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p lang="en-US">Connect teachers, administrators, parents, and taxpayers so they can discuss important educational policy issues.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in the summer of 2011, we <a href="http://jaycollier.net/strategy/collaboration/discovery/">developed a digital strategy</a>, <a href="http://jaycollier.net/strategy/collaboration/creating-learnmaine/">built a demonstration site</a>&nbsp;in less than a month&nbsp;and&nbsp;drafted <a href="http://mainelearning.net/about/user-generated-content-policy/">policies for user-generated content</a>. Initial funding was earmarked in November 2011, the initiative was&nbsp;integrated into the Department’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maine.gov/doe/plan/index.html">strategic plan</a>&nbsp;in January 2012, and&nbsp;the version 2.0&nbsp;<a href="http://mainelearning.net">production site</a> went live in February 2012. During the following months, the Department approved 21 practice groups&nbsp;with 250 active members.</p>\n<h2>Architecting engagement</h2>\n<p><a href="http://jaycollier.net/files/2013/01/ocp-engagement.png" class="fancybox" rel="gallery-0"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-22496 no-border" title="ocp-engagement" alt="" src="http://jaycollier.net/files/2013/01/ocp-engagement-300x236.png" width="300" height="236" /></a></p>\n<p>From day one, we wanted the platform to support increasing levels of engagement, from initial observations (“lurking,” in the positive sense) all the way through to moderating and leading practice teams.</p>\n<p>Although the OCOP would be launched quietly and was limited to Department-approved practice groups and members during 2012, from the start all group conversations were intended to be visible to the world: a virtual version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)">fishbowl model</a>&nbsp;of collaboration.</p>\n<p>We wanted members to be able to receive activity notifications immediately or via daily or weekly digests. We wanted visitors to be able to&nbsp;<a href="http://mainelearning.net/about/">follow any group</a>&nbsp;by subscribing to its feed via the Blogtrottr service.</p>\n<p>Then, after implementing the collaboration features, the next phase would be a&nbsp;<a href="http://mainelearning.net/resources/">learning resources directory</a>, which would contain recommendations (via URL) for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital learning&nbsp;<strong>objects</strong>, such as content, multimedia, applications, lesson plans, and syllabi that can be used anytime, on any device, in any setting, at home and in classrooms, and through self-directed study and professional development initiatives, and</li>\n<li>Digital learning&nbsp;<strong>opportunities</strong>, including classes, courses, workshops and professional development sessions and that provide live interaction between, and among, students and teachers, learning coaches and community mentors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whereas there already countless global resource repositories — containing both free and “premium” objects — when we began, there were no registries that organized links to resources based on Maine-specific needs and standards, and no single repository contained links to local Maine learning resources: expanded learning opportunities, service-learning projects, and community mentoring opportunities. Our Resource Directory was created to do just that.</p>\n<h2>Laying the foundations</h2>\n<p>From the start, our goal was to deliver a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimal viable product</a>&nbsp;to demonstrate potential, and then to rapidly iterate while adding functions requested by our early users. Our first step was to identify the platform that could be quickly configured to support familiar kinds of online collaboration — forums, document sharing, wiki pages, blog posts, and status updates — while being able to support our vision of the ideal future platform.</p>\n<p>So, we pulled together all of the requests we’d received from DOE staff and constituents (including features from a series of previous projects) and created a detailed&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnN5FWMlt7YEdENCalRRdExFU3RfSkE1X0J3dUhhQWc">list of criteria</a>, for which we made an initial evaluation using the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_group_technique">NGT</a>&nbsp;ranking technique. (See tabs along the bottom of the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnN5FWMlt7YEdENCalRRdExFU3RfSkE1X0J3dUhhQWc">spreadsheet</a>&nbsp;for details.)</p>\n<p>Since we knew we wanted to create a framework that could be&nbsp;easily replicated by school districts and other learning organizations and jurisdictions, and&nbsp;at low cost,&nbsp;we started with the open-source frameworks supported by our state’s IT office: Drupal and&nbsp;WordPress. We determined that both platforms were viable, and chose WordPress because it could be easily configured by non-technologists. The BuddyPress environment was critical to meeting our defined criteria.</p>\n<h2>Building on WordPress and BuddyPress</h2>\n<p>We started with minimal resources — 40% of my time, external hosting services, and about 40 hours for back-end administration and quality control for plugin code for the first 9 months. We contracted with SiteGround for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.siteground.com/vps_hosting.htm">cloud VPS hosting</a>&nbsp;and with BuddyPress developer&nbsp;<a href="http://buddypress.org/community/members/boonebgorges/profile/">Boone Gorges</a>&nbsp;for back-end support. Boone set up a public&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/MaineLearning/MaineLearning">GitHub repository</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;configured our server for the Git development workflow. I installed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/">MAMP</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/gmask/">Gas Mask</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://mac.github.com/">GitHub for Mac</a>&nbsp;on my own machine for local development.</p>\n<p>Since I am a strategist (rather than a back-end developer), I found it quite easy to implement desired features by finding and evaluating WordPress plugins, installing, activating, and testing them on my local machine, and, if acceptable, pushing them to the current development branch at GitHub, all without needing coding experience. When needed, I asked Boone to provide recommendations, check for PHP errors, and add site-specific code to meet our needs. He would then push to production.</p>\n<h3>Configuration and theming</h3>\n<p>To get started, I installed WordPress multisite (using subdirectories rather than subdomains) and installed BuddyPress on the main site. I chose to use the BuddyPress default theme for the main site and the Genesis framework for subsites; all customizations were to child themes. I made continuous interface tweaks via the Custom CSS plugin, and for each periodic push from development to production, I moved those changes into each theme’s styles.css file for versioning.</p>\n<h3>Plugins</h3>\n<p>Here are some of the key plugins we’re currently using with WP 3.4 and BP 1.6. Most of these are perennials that have been maintained through many core software updates, and across multiple projects.</p>\n<h4>Administration</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow Multiple Accounts</li>\n<li>Gravity Forms (premium)</li>\n<li>Gravity Forms + Custom Post Types</li>\n<li>Network Privacy</li>\n<li>TurboCSV (premium)</li>\n<li>Types and&nbsp;WP-Views (now WP-Toolset, premium)</li>\n<li>User Switching</li>\n<li>WP Optimize</li>\n<li>WP Super Cache</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Authoring and back-end</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Admin Menu Editor</li>\n<li>Broken Link Checker</li>\n<li>Enable Media Replace</li>\n<li>Events Manager</li>\n<li>Post Type Switcher</li>\n<li>Resize at Upload</li>\n<li>TinyMCE Advanced</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>BuddyPress</h4>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyPress</li>\n<li>BP Group Documents</li>\n<li>BP Group Management</li>\n<li>BP Group Organizer</li>\n<li>BuddyPress Docs</li>\n<li>BuddyPress Edit Group Slug</li>\n<li>BuddyPress Group Email</li>\n<li>BuddyPress Moderation</li>\n<li>Invite Anyone</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Integration with external services</h4>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Akismet</li>\n<li>Learning Registry Display Widget</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Interface and navigation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Autolink URI</li>\n<li>CryptX</li>\n<li>Custom CSS Manager (moving into Jet Pack)</li>\n<li>External Links</li>\n<li>Hide Broken Shortcodes</li>\n<li>No Page Comment</li>\n<li>Query Multiple Taxonomies</li>\n<li>Theme Test Drive</li>\n<li>WP Page-Navi</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Of course, our use of these plugins is always provisional; I continue to evaluate alternatives that will meet our requirements even better. Indeed, we are already in the process of replacing some of these plugins with alternatives.</p>\n<h3>Customization</h3>\n<p>We added a number of code snippets to the functions file for minor customizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We added navigation buttons to activity stream items</li>\n<li>We changed the default member avatar</li>\n<li>We loaded common site-specific CSS styles into TinyMCE drop-down menus</li>\n<li>We adapted&nbsp;<a href="http://helen.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/using-chosen-for-a-replacement-taxonomy-metabox/">Helen Hou’s implementation</a>&nbsp;of the Chosen multi-select list styling to simplify back-end metaboxes for multiple taxonomies</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A note on custom content&nbsp;types, fields, and taxonomies</h3>\n<p>For the Learning Resources Directory, I needed to create and maintain&nbsp;custom post types, field groups, and taxonomies to support a rather complex data structure for metadata for our learning standards: the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maine.gov/education/lres/pei/index.html">Maine Learning Results</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.corestandards.org/the-standards">Common Core State Standards</a>.</p>\n<p>After having tried nearly every plugin option (and combination), I settled on&nbsp;<a href="http://wp-types.com/">WP Types &amp; Views</a>&nbsp;(now called WP-Toolset), which allowed me to rapidly prototype and improve data structures. Then, I used&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/">Gravity Forms</a>&nbsp;to create&nbsp;<a href="http://mainelearning.net/resources/recommend/">front-end forms</a>&nbsp;to prompt educators to organize and classify their recommended resources.</p>\n<p>This work has only just begun, but WP-Toolset has provided all the features we’ve needed; indeed it can be compared favorably with the Blocks, Views, Panes, and Panels modules and functions for Drupal. Indeed, I’ll be experimenting with WP-Toolset’s&nbsp;<a href="http://wp-types.com/home/cred/">CRED feature</a> to more easily integration between front-end forms and structured data.</p>\n<h2>Today</h2>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://mainelearning.net/">online community of practice</a>&nbsp;has now been fully-functional since March, 2012. Since then,&nbsp;the Department has approved 21 practice groups&nbsp;with 250 members; the more active groups have included: the&nbsp;<a href="http://mainelearning.net/groups/dlag/">Digital Learning Advisory Group</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://mainelearning.net/groups/cdln/">Cross Discipline Literacy Network</a>&nbsp;(and its 10 subgroups), the&nbsp;<a href="http://mainelearning.net/groups/arts-leaders/">Maine Arts Education Leaders</a>&nbsp;cohort, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://mainelearning.net/groups/dcs/">Digital Citizenship in Schools</a>&nbsp;discussion group. We recently added a space for service-learning coordinators and practitioners, and maintain a list of group and membership requests.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://mainelearning.net/resources">learning resources directory</a>&nbsp;has been tested by a variety of educators, with continuous improvements based on user feedback. The Arts Education cohort is developing a peer review process for those who ask for review of their submissions. Wikipedia-style ratings will be implemented next.</p>\n<p>Currently, program direction, platform administration, and community stewardship functions are being performed by myself (Jay Collier) and our back-end developer, Boone Gorges (core software developer for the collaboration software).</p>\n<h2>Next phase</h2>\n<p>We’ve now been live for almost one year. As we approach the end of our current funding and contract cycles, the state of Maine has been working to sustain MaineLearning.net.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Department of Education has been planning to initiate a public communications campaign and is seeking funding to fund program leadership and community stewardship through the next level of service, including those potential enhancements listed below.</li>\n<li>The state’s Office of Information Technology has been developing an RFP that will seek external vendors to provide&nbsp;Internet hosting, software management, and back-end development to support the continuous improvement of the platform when the current funding and contracts end this spring.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With sufficient resources, we are considering many potential enhancements, including the following, all of which are possible within the current framework, given additional staffing:</p>\n<h4>Potential collaboration enhancements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allowing open group applications and selecting new groups based upon capacity</li>\n<li>Professional development support, including organic groups for sustained collaboration between webinars, seminars, and workshops</li>\n<li>Active management of resource vetting teams, including rubric development, and credential design (badges)</li>\n<li>Availability of sub-sites (blogs) for every group, upon request</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Potential resource directory enhancements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Statewide promotion for crowdsourced resource sharing</li>\n<li>Simplified resource submission interfaces and predefined search results</li>\n<li>Multiple levels of evaluation options, from thumbs up/down, to multi-question reviews, to peer review workflows</li>\n<li>Exchange of vetting data (paradata) via US DOE Learning Registry and other repositories</li>\n<li>Ingest of pre-existing learning resources, from vetted OERs to professional development objects, to community learning opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Potential administrative initiatives</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant applications for funding from regional and national foundations</li>\n<li>Consulting with other jurisdictions that wish to replicate the model</li>\n<li>Contributing lessons learned and custom add-ons back to the open-source community</li>\n<li>Investigating viability of integrating ePortfolio and learning management (ScholarPress) features into the platform</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Toward the future of learning</h2>\n<p>In <a href="http://www.maine.gov/doe/plan/index.html"><em>Education Evolving</em> </a>(<a href="http://www.maine.gov/doe/plan/strategic_plan_web_final.pdf">PDF</a>) — Maine’s 2012 strategic plan for learning in Maine — Commissioner Bowen worked with educators around the state to define the challenges and opportunities of 21st-century education.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To build on the great work being done in Maine’s schools today, and to move from a century-old model of schooling to a more effective, learner-centered approach in the process, will require a steady focus on a handful of core priorities organized around meeting the individual learning needs of all students …</p>\n<p>Such a move won’t take place through the imposition of heavy-handed mandates or one-size-fits-all approaches from Augusta, but by building on the innovative work being done in schools across Maine already and by employing strategies to increase collaboration and sharing of best practices….</p>\n<p>As Harvard’s Tony Wagner argues in his book <em>The Global Achievement Gap</em>, teaching has been and continues to be a largely solitary practice providing few opportunities for collaboration and sharing of best practices…</p>\n<p>With the advent of &nbsp;the Internet, the sharing of new ideas and new approaches to teaching can be far more readily facilitated. Instructional materials, research on best practices, and even videos of effective instructional methods can be shared instantly across the state and around the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Collaborative, learner-centered education is at the heart of Maine’s strategy for transforming learning communities for this new era and <a href="http://MaineLearning.net">MaineLearning.net</a>&nbsp;supports that strategy.</p>\n<p><em>Watch an introduction to Innovations in Maine Learning, including the MaineLearning.net online community of practice and learning resources directory: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/collier/innovations-in-maine-education">http://www.slideshare.net/collier/innovations-in-maine-education</a></em></p>\n</p>\n<p><em>This case study was supported by the <a href="http://maine.gov/doe/">Maine Department of Education</a>.

For the past few years I&#8217;ve had this photo in my office:</p>\n<p><a href="http://s.ma.tt/files/2013/01/ali-williams.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-42117" alt="Ali - Williams (Overhead)" src="http://i2.wp.com/s.ma.tt/files/2013/01/ali-williams.jpg?resize=640%2C648" /></a></p>\n<p>The story behind it is pretty interesting, taken from <a href="http://bermangraphics.com/press/leifer.htm">this interview with Larry Berman and Chris Maher</a>:</p>\n<div class="blockquote">\n<blockquote><b>Chris/Larry: </b>It&#8217;s actually quite a different question to say what are your favorites verses what do you feel are your best photographs.</p>\n<p><b>Neil:</b> I know, and my best picture ever, in my opinion, is my Ali Cleveland Williams picture that I shot from overhead. I don’t usually hang my own photos, I collect other people’s pictures. But that picture’s been hanging in my living room as long as I can remember. I have a 40&#215;40 print of it which is hung in a diamond shape with Williams at the top. That&#8217;s the guy that’s on the canvas on his back.</p>\n<p><b>Chris/Larry:</b> It’s remarkably abstract for a sports picture.</p>\n<p><b>Neil:</b> I think it’s the only picture in my career that there’s nothing I would do different with it. You look at pictures and think that you can always improve them no matter how successful the shoot is. Part of what motivates you to go on to the next shoot is every once in a while you get a picture, whether it&#8217;s the cover of the magazine or an inside spread, that&#8217;s as good as you think you could have made it. And then a week later you see a couple of things that you could improve slightly. A month later you might see a few more things. It doesn’t diminish the quality of that picture. It simply means that there&#8217;s always room for improvement.</p>\n<p><b>Chris/Larry:</b> You’re learning for the future?</p>\n<p><b>Neil:</b> Exactly. It’s sort of what motivates you to go on. If I were to do the Cleveland Williams Ali picture again, I would do it exactly the same. And more important is that no one will ever do it better because it can’t be done like that anymore. Today the ring is different and the fighters dress in multi colored outfits like wrestlers. Back then the champ wore white and the challenger wore black.  Today, when you look down at the ring from above, you see the Budweiser Beer logo in the center and around it is the network logo that’s televising the fight. Whether it’s Showtime or HBO, they have their logo two or three times on the canvas. The logo of promoter of the fight, Don King Presents, is also visible. That&#8217;s why that picture couldn&#8217;t be taken today. So not only did the picture work out better than any I’ve ever taken, but it’s one that’ll never be taken again.</p>\n<p><img alt="©Neil Leifer" src="http://i0.wp.com/bermangraphics.com/images/Neil-Ali_Williams-p143.jpg?resize=300%2C265" border="0" /></p>\n<p><b>Chris/Larry:</b> Where are you in this picture?</p>\n<p><b>Neil:</b> I’m at 11:00 o’clock, as I remember it. I’m in a blue shirt leaning on the canvas with a camera in each hand.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>It&#8217;s always an honor to have a great creator make their home on the web with WordPress.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 11:22:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"bbPress: bbPress 2.3 Beta 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://bbpress.org/?p=125680";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"http://bbpress.org/blog/2013/01/bbpress-2-3-beta-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1186:"<p>Today we tagged bbPress 2.3 beta 1 in the WordPress.org plugin repository.

You don&#8217;t just want to create and share your stuff &#8212; you want to connect with people who share your interests and passions in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p>Publishing a post is just one step in blogging &#8212; getting people to engage with you is another. How do you start a conversation?</p>\n<h3>Here are some tips:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>End with a prompt.</strong> At the end of a post, encourage comments by asking a specific question or two, which is a better way of generating feedback than more general &#8220;Leave a comment&#8221; or &#8220;What do you think?&#8221; prompts. Your blog isn’t just a monologue &#8212; you want to open up the discussion to others.</li>\n<li><strong>Reply to comments.</strong> Your job doesn’t end when you hit publish. When readers leave comments, keep the conversation going with a thoughtful reply.</li>\n<li><strong>But don’t reply to every comment.</strong> If you receive many comments and reply to each with a generic one-liner (&#8220;Thanks!&#8221;), your comment thread won&#8217;t be interesting. Feel free to reply to first-time visitors to welcome them to your site, but in general, reply only if you have something substantial to add to the existing conversation.</li>\n<li><strong>Moderate with care.</strong> It’s best not to encourage or allow nasty and abusive comments. They intimidate new readers, derail conversations, and distract you from good blogging. It&#8217;s <em>your</em> online home &#8212; don&#8217;t be afraid to give polite warnings to visitors who aren&#8217;t appropriate.</li>\n<li><strong>Post commenting guidelines.</strong> If you find yourself doing a lot of policing, one way to be transparent about the type of comments you will and will not permit is to post simple guidelines. This can help you attract the kind of commenters you want, and deter unwanted behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>Return the visit.</strong> Developing friendships with your readers is one of the best parts of blogging. If you have loyal commenters, make sure you visit and engage on their blogs, too. If they like what you post, chances are you’ll be into their stuff as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/pingomatic.wordpress.com/77/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/pingomatic.wordpress.com/77/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.pingomatic.com&blog=68432&post=77&subd=pingomatic&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 19:22:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Cheri Lucas";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"WP Android: 2.2.6 Update";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"http://android.wordpress.org/?p=744";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"http://android.wordpress.org/2013/01/24/2-2-6-update/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1409:"<div id="attachment_748" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2-2-6.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-748 " alt="Holo in Version 2.2.6" src="http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2-2-6.png?w=180&h=300" width="180" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">UI Improvements in Version 2.2.6</p></div>\n<p>The 2.2.6 update of WordPress for Android is now available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android">Google Play</a>.</p>\n<h4>Changes in this release</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Small UI Improvements</li>\n<li>Improved support for connecting over HTTPS.</li>\n<li>Crash fixes for <a href="http://android.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/394">#394</a> and <a href="http://android.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/395">#395</a>.</li>\n<li>Code cleanup and optimization &#8211; app size is smaller.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Get involved</h4>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress for Android is an open source project?

Backflip makes mobile games, and they have awesome artwork. It&#8217;s always a treat to work with beautiful content.</p>\n<p>This was a pretty straight-forward WordPress CMS site. We created a custom post type for their games so they can easily manage them (and add new ones, etc.). We also integrated <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/carrington-build/">Carrington Build</a> so they can maintain the pages and custom layouts themselves.</p>\n<p>We had a lot of fun implementing the front-end of the site.

It was an exciting day, <a href="http://www.skycombatace.com/">I got to fly a plane, dogfight another</a>, and do some aerobatics like a tumble, which was pretty much the coolest thing ever. Unusually for me, I managed to stay away from my computer the entire weekend, instead spending time eating, drinking, and dancing with a few friends who were also in Las Vegas. I came back online to some very sweet birthday blogs (thank you <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/happy-birthday-and-anniversary-matt-mullenweg/">Lorelle</a>, <a href="http://wpengine.com/2013/01/happy-29th-birthday-matt/">Austin</a>, and <a href="http://wpdaily.co/birthday-matt-2013/">John</a>!) and of course a number of nice messages on Facebook and <a href="http://twitter.com/photomatt">Twitter</a>. All in all, extremely pleasant.</p>\n<p>I travelled more this year than I ever have before, covering 261,077 miles in 292 days away from San Francisco (79 cities, 11 countries).</p>\n<p>From the outside my life sometimes can appear crazy, and my 20s have been atypical in many ways, but one of the things I appreciate the most about this past year is that things have been getting less hectic overall. Much of this I attribute technology which I&#8217;ve finally gotten to a point where the majority of it in my life serves to allow me to spend doing things I love, like writing, designing, coding, learning, and less time on infrastructure or overhead.</p>\n<p>The most interesting thing about twenty-nine so far is I&#8217;ve been getting lots of tips from people on how to end my 20s, which usually fall under &#8220;go out with a bang&#8221; from people currently in their 20s and &#8220;don&#8217;t worry it just gets better from here&#8221; from people in their 30s.</p>\n<p>My focus this year will be on simplification and streamlining. As in many years past, I find I&#8217;m the most balanced when I take time every day to read, especially in the morning, and as an additional resolution this year I&#8217;m trying to watch a film every week recommended by friends.

The question which started this conversation by Doug Stewart is as follows: &#8220;<em>A question for which I have no answer: why do all WordPress news sites seem to come with an expiration date?</em>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>When I <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/12/19/technorati-lacks-authority/">first started writing about WordPress</a> back in 2007, there were a couple of news sites I relied on for WordPress news on a regular basis. While Weblogtoolscollection.com is still chugging along, sites such as WPHacks and WPCandy fell by the wayside a year or two after I got involved with the community. Since 2007, I&#8217;ve been able to witness multiple sites sprout up like seedlings only to die off before their first bloom. I tried to not let that happen to WPTavern and for long time readers, I think that was obvious but in the end, life became too much.</p>\n<p>In its heyday, WPTavern was filled with success and the forums were a wonderful place to be. I was hanging out on the website multiple hours of every day and night chatting it up on the forum, Twitter, and posting articles on the site. I was sitting in my room, living with my parents in their apartment for hours during the day and night, at the PC just typing away. This is the reason WPTavern was able to grow at a steady pace over the course of 2009-2011. Over the course of those two years, I tried to find a way to make the site sustainable and to help me pay the bills every month. I thoroughly enjoyed just sitting at the PC all day typing articles and sharing my thoughts on what was buzzing around the WordPress community. Unfortunately, not being able to get a paycheck every week for doing it caught up with me. I tried display advertising, some affiliate marketing, and sponsorships, but at the end of the day, I was no salesman or marketer and I probably shortchanged myself numerous times. While I was working full time at the grocery store at night, I really thought WPTavern would be my way out of that hell hole which is why I decreased the hours I worked their during the week to concentrate on really making WPTavern be my main source of income. It didn&#8217;t work and within a month or two, I was back to working my 36 hour shift at the store. What would have been ideal is for someone like the grocery store to just give me a paycheck every week for sitting on my ass and writing about WordPress. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad I found a buyer for the site when I did and the price they paid me was far superior to my asking price. I have a terrible habit of selling myself short. However, if I were to start a WordPress news centric site today, this is how I&#8217;d do it.</p>\n<p>First, I would find a team of people that had some expertise in a couple of different areas such as themes, plugins and WordPress hacks. I&#8217;d also hire a guy to write about the various services Automattic offers. I&#8217;d also try and find a guy that could write about the various projects such as BuddyPress and bbPress. A kick ass WordPress news centric site would need a smart, dedicated team of people to write about all those subjects. I think they would have a hard time not ever having anything to write about. While I tried to do this with WPTavern, I simply couldn&#8217;t bring myself to ask people to work for free. I did ask for guest posts but those were rarely delivered upon. So the question you&#8217;ll need to ask yourself is <em>where do you get the funding for such a team?</em> </p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is, unless you&#8217;re some super salesman or having a big company backing you, WordPress News Centric sites don&#8217;t make squat for cash. At least that&#8217;s my experience. Nothing that would pay my $700.00 mortgage every month and give me money for food. The money that I earned for affiliates and display advertising was unpredictable which was a giant hassle on me financially. </p>\n<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t think people need WordPress news centric sites anymore. Based on my experience, if you follow the right 100 people or so on Twitter, they provide you with most of what you&#8217;ll need to know within the WordPress community. Between Twitter the mailing lists (WPMail.me) and the various RSS feeds for the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/">WP community Make websites</a>, that&#8217;s enough to keep you in the know. However, there is one facet to all of this that I think could be explored a little deeper and that is the idea of <strong>Curation</strong>. I believe that WPTavern did a great job in curating content and publishing links to things that you needed to know about or be aware of. Considering all of the different pipes of information both official and unofficial regarding the WordPress project, there is still a need for an excellent curator or a team of curators. However, the best curation I have seen over the past year or so has been from the <a href="http://wpmail.me/">WPMail.me</a> newsletter. It&#8217;s free and they have done a great job of giving people links of information they should be aware of. I find that between Twitter and this newsletter, I&#8217;m generally in the loop of what is going on within the community. </p>\n<p>My advice to anyone wanting to start a WordPress news centric website, especially if you think it&#8217;s going to make you some money is to stop immediately. Focus your efforts on where the real cash is. Commercial plugins, themes, and services. A news centric website takes so much time and energy to maintain and keep fresh, it&#8217;s not worth it in the long run unless you have a company backing you and providing you a steady stream of cash that pays the bills and puts food on the table at the same time. Every time I thought about it, I couldn&#8217;t come up with a reason that I could use to convince someone else to pay me to sit on my ass and write about WordPress all day. The value and worth comes from writing code, not text. At least that&#8217;s my conclusion.</p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/is-it-time-to-refocus-the-dashboard-for-news" rel="bookmark"

Just click on &#8220;help translate&#8221; next to any of the <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/site/translations/" target="_blank">currently available languages</a>, or visit the Gravatar GlotPress page to see exactly what still needs to be done, learn how to become a translator, and add your language to the list.</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gravatar.wordpress.com/425/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gravatar.wordpress.com/425/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.gravatar.com&blog=1886259&post=425&subd=gravatar&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 18:54:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"michelle w.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Theme Releases for 1/14";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=12524";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/QHPiV0XVKfs/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1778:"<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/alkane"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12528" alt="screenshot" src="http://i2.wp.com/weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/screenshot3.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/alkane"><strong>Alkane</strong></a> is a simple, customizable, and clean theme.</p>\n<p><a href="http://blankthemes.com/landscape/"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12525" alt="landscape-screenshot" src="http://i1.wp.com/weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/landscape-screenshot.jpeg?resize=150%2C150" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://blankthemes.com/landscape/"><strong>Landscape</strong></a> is a simple and responsive theme, perfect for photography sites.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/newschannel"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12527" alt="screenshot-1" src="http://i0.wp.com/weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/screenshot-13.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/newschannel"><strong>Newschannel</strong></a> is a pretty versatile theme, that places the emphasis of the home page and archive pages on featured images.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/panels"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12526" alt="screenshot-2" src="http://i0.wp.com/weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/screenshot-22.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/panels"><strong>Panels</strong></a> is a panel-based theme theme with custom header, custom background, custom menus, and widgets.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/QHPiV0XVKfs" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 14:00:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"James";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 21:43:51 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"119498";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 21:30:13 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT luv 139";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20121217182747";}', 'no');

It would be a valuable tool for everyone working in ancient DNA. It could build off the list of "species to bring back". I''m thinking of a full list of extinct species within the age range that DNA is viable to retrieve, with some information on collections housing tissue or fossil material, taxonomy information, and some references to literature. In this way a person designing an ancient DNA project could find out what species have no previous DNA sequenced, what species do, and to what extent. With this list we can then append how suitable a species is for revival.”</blockquote>'),

The current generation of biologists will write the next chapter.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>BIOTECH</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>REGENESIS: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves</strong>\r\n– George Church and Ed Regis (2012 – due out in October)\r\n\r\nOne of the world’s leading genomic engineers spells out how rapidly his field is developing radical capabilities. (Church is involved in the passenger pigeon revival project.)</li>\r\n	<li><strong>BIOLOGY IS TECHNOLOGY: The Promise, Peril, and New Business of Engineering Life</strong>\r\n– Robert H. Carlson. (2011)\r\n\r\nRob Carlson is currently the best chronicler of the pace and range of progress in biotechnology.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>THE MOLECULE HUNT: Archaeology and the Search for Ancient DNA</strong>\r\n– Martin Jones (2001)\r\n\r\nA little dated already, this account by an insider covers the early years of biomolecular archaeology. There needs to be a new book on current “ancient DNA” discoveries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>REWILDING</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR: A Saga of Natural History and Conservation</strong>\r\n– Noel Snyder and Helen Snyder (2000)\r\n\r\nDown to 22 birds in 1981, the condor is back to over 400, with half of them now in the wild. This encyclopedic work shows how important good field science was. A shorter version is Introduction to the California Condor (2005) by the same authors.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>ZOO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY\r\n</strong>– John Fa, Stephan Funk, Donnamarie O’Connell (2011)\r\n\r\nAn excellent survey of the growing role of zoos in conservation biology, including captive breeding and return to the wild. Zoos will be crucial for de-extinction biology.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>AMERICAN CHESTNUT: The Life, Death, and Rebirth of a Perfect Tree</strong>\r\n– Susan Freinkel (2007)\r\n\r\nThe revivers of the American chestnut are four decades ahead of everyone else in bringing back an important missing species. For updates, get the quarterly Journal of <a href="http://www.acf.org/">The American Chestnut Foundation</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>ONCE AND FUTURE GIANTS: What Ice Age Extinctions Tell Us About the Fate of Earth’s Largest Animals</strong>\r\n– Sharon Levy (2011)\r\n\r\nA fine introduction to mammoths and mastodons and what it might mean to have them back.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>PASSENGER PIGEON</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>THE PASSENGER PIGEON: Its Natural History and Extinction</strong>\r\n– A.

(1733, 68, 'column_1', '<h3>FORWARD TO THE PAST</h3>\r\n<strong>De-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>October 23 – 24, 2012</em>\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>De-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.</li>\r\n	<li>It’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.</li>\r\n	<li>Research on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.</li>\r\n	<li>Mutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.</li>\r\n	<li>Priority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.</li>\r\n	<li>De-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.</li>\r\n	<li>To deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):</li>\r\n	<li>well-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)</li>\r\n	<li>regular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue</li>\r\n	<li>This level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Successes with cloning</strong></h3>\r\nTo begin the first session, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Alberto Fernández-Arias</strong> </span>reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oliver Ryder</span> </strong>said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Robert Lanza</span> </strong>focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n<h3><strong>Some projects underway</strong></h3>\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Henri Kerkdijk-Otten</span></strong>. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Insung Hwang</span> </strong>gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Michael Archer</span> </strong>and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">David French</span> </strong>described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Michael Archer</span> </strong>explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marilyn Renfree</span></strong>. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n<h3><strong>Emerging genomic techniques</strong></h3>\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">George Church</span> </strong>began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ben Novak</span></strong>. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Michael McGrew</span></strong>, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jean-Marie Rouillard</strong> </span>said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guojie Zhang</span> </strong>noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n<h3><strong>Interpreting extinct molecules</strong></h3>\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tom Gilbert</span></strong>, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mary Schweitzer</span> </strong>showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Michi Hofreiter</span></strong>, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hendrik Poinar</span> </strong>explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n<h3><strong>Reviving extinct ecosystems</strong></h3>\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sergey Zimov</span></strong>, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frans Vera</span> </strong>also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> David Burney’s</span></strong> presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">William Powell</span> </strong>explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n<h3><strong>Conservation perspectives</strong></h3>\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Joel Berger</strong> </span>had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kate Jones</span> </strong>said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peter Kareiva</span> </strong>noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stanley Temple</span> </strong>said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n<h3><strong>De-extinction ethics</strong></h3>\r\nThe “ethics panel,” <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hank Greely</span> </strong>pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hillary Bok</span> </strong>urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alejandro Camacho</span> </strong>said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jacob Sherkow</span> </strong>raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nathan Wolfe</span> </strong>suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n<h3><strong>Why do it?</strong></h3>\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n<h3><strong>Whither the tech?</strong></h3>\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n<h3><strong>Reversing extinction vs. preventing extinction</strong></h3>\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells.</li>\r\n	<li>Enough specimens for genetic diversity.</li>\r\n	<li>A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nConservation prefers:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Beloved species.</li>\r\n	<li>Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species.</li>\r\n	<li>Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species).</li>\r\n	<li>Manageable for captive breeding.</li>\r\n	<li>Suitable habitat available.</li>\r\n	<li>Can’t do ecological harm.</li>\r\n	<li>Removable if it does prove harmful.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3><strong>More on restoring ecosystems</strong></h3>\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n<h3><strong>Next steps</strong></h3>\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ross MacPhee</span> </strong>had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n<em>(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1741, 435, 'column_1', 'FORWARD TO THE PAST\r\n\r\nDe-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics\r\n\r\nOctober 23 – 24, 2012\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report ?by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1744, 437, 'column_1', 'FORWARD TO THE PAST\r\n\r\nDe-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics\r\n\r\nOctober 23 – 24, 2012\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report ?by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1747, 438, 'column_1', 'FORWARD TO THE PAST\r\n\r\nDe-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics\r\n\r\nOctober 23 – 24, 2012\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report ?by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1750, 439, 'column_1', 'FORWARD TO THE PAST\r\n\r\nDe-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics\r\n\r\nOctober 23 – 24, 2012\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report ?by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1753, 440, 'column_1', 'FORWARD TO THE PAST\r\n\r\nDe-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics\r\n\r\nOctober 23 – 24, 2012\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report ?by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1756, 441, 'column_1', 'FORWARD TO THE PAST\r\n\r\nDe-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics\r\n\r\nOctober 23 – 24, 2012\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report ?by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1759, 442, 'column_1', '<h3>FORWARD TO THE PAST</h3>\r\nDe-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics\r\n\r\nOctober 23 – 24, 2012\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report ?by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1762, 443, 'column_1', '<h3>FORWARD TO THE PAST</h3>\r\nDe-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics\r\n\r\nOctober 23 – 24, 2012\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report ?by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1765, 444, 'column_1', '<h3>FORWARD TO THE PAST</h3>\r\nDe-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics\r\n\r\nOctober 23 – 24, 2012\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report ?by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1770, 446, 'column_1', '<h3>FORWARD TO THE PAST</h3>\r\n<strong>De-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>October 23 – 24, 2012</em>\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1773, 447, 'column_1', '<h3>FORWARD TO THE PAST</h3>\r\n<strong>De-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>October 23 – 24, 2012</em>\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1776, 448, 'column_1', '<h3>FORWARD TO THE PAST</h3>\r\n<strong>De-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>October 23 – 24, 2012</em>\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1779, 449, 'column_1', '<h3>FORWARD TO THE PAST</h3>\r\n<strong>De-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>October 23 – 24, 2012</em>\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1782, 450, 'column_1', '<h3>FORWARD TO THE PAST</h3>\r\n<strong>De-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>October 23 – 24, 2012</em>\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1785, 451, 'column_1', '<h3>FORWARD TO THE PAST</h3>\r\n<strong>De-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>October 23 – 24, 2012</em>\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

(1788, 452, 'column_1', '<h3>FORWARD TO THE PAST</h3>\r\n<strong>De-extinction projects, techniques, and ethics</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>October 23 – 24, 2012</em>\r\n\r\nNational Geographic, Washington, DC?\r\nSponsors: National Geographic Society with Revive and Restore\r\n\r\nMeeting Report by Stewart Brand (Dec. 2012)\r\n\r\nIt was a two-day meeting, described as a private, get-acquainted workshop. The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n\r\nResearch on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n\r\nMutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n\r\nPriority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n\r\nDe-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n\r\nTo deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n\r\nwell-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n\r\nregular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n\r\nThis level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.\r\n\r\nTo open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n\r\nSuccesses with cloning\r\n\r\nTo begin the first session, Alberto Fernández-Arias reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. Oliver Ryder said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).\r\n\r\nThe Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.\r\n\r\nNow that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill.\r\n\r\nRobert Lanza focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.\r\n\r\nAs for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n\r\nSome projects underway\r\n\r\nThe aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said Henri Kerkdijk-Otten. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.\r\n\r\nThe species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.\r\n\r\nThe project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.\r\n\r\nThe most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. Insung Hwang gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.\r\n\r\nAlso off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. Michael Archer and David French described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species\r\n\r\nOne reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, Michael Archer explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.\r\n\r\nIf the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by Marilyn Renfree. The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation (Col2a1) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n\r\nEmerging genomic techniques\r\n\r\nGeorge Church began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nChurch’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.\r\n\r\nRevive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by Ben Novak. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michael McGrew, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.\r\n\r\nNoting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential, Jean-Marie Rouillard said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, Guojie Zhang noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n\r\n?Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\nDNA is a fragile molecule, said Tom Gilbert, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)\r\n\r\nNo DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but Mary Schweitzer showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to PCR techniques, said Michi Hofreiter, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.\r\n\r\nStudying mammoth ancient DNA, Hendrik Poinar explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n\r\nReviving extinct ecosystems\r\n\r\nVast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said Sergey Zimov, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nZimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.\r\n\r\nZimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”\r\n\r\nFrans Vera also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.\r\n\r\nHuge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.\r\n\r\nThe use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in David Burney’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.\r\n\r\nHundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.\r\n\r\nBurney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).\r\n\r\nAmerica’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. William Powell explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.\r\n\r\nPowell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n\r\nConservation perspectives\r\n\r\nThe second day began with a panel of conservation professionals, moderated by National Geographic’s John Francis. Joel Berger had a cautionary tale to report, based on his experience in 2006 with eleven other scientists who proposed a “Pleistocene rewilding” project for North America. The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.\r\n\r\nNature magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?”\r\n\r\nKate Jones said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)\r\n\r\nPeter Kareiva noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.\r\n\r\nStanley Temple said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They want the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n\r\nDe-extinction ethics\r\n\r\nThe “ethics panel,” Hank Greely pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. Hillary Bok urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. Alejandro Camacho said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited.\r\n\r\nJacob Sherkow raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. Nathan Wolfe suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.\r\n\r\nHank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy do it?\r\n\r\nGeorge Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.\r\n\r\nHenri Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n\r\nWhither the tech?\r\n\r\nDiscussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work. On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n\r\nReversing extinction vs. preventing extinction\r\n\r\nIn discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”\r\n\r\nWhich extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n\r\nMore on restoring ecosystems\r\n\r\nDuring discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nIn the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there will be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“\r\n\r\nWilliam Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n\r\n• Ross MacPhee had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nStewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

birds have 1.5 billion.)\r\n\r\nBandtail1Band-tailed pigeonThe closest relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata), which is common in the American west.  Church’s idea is to sequence both birds (there are hundreds of specimens of the passenger pigeon in museums), compare their genomes, and then gene by gene (trait by trait) transform the band-tailed genome into that of a passenger pigeon.\r\n\r\nFor example, a passenger pigeon has a much longer tail than a band-tailed pigeon.  Once you’ve found the genome sequence that determines the tail length, you replace that sequence in the band-tailed pigeon with the tail-length sequence from the passenger pigeon.  You take, say, twelve changes you want---a few for tail size, a few for color (red eye, peach-colored breast), a few that are behavioral---check that each set works in separate birds and then breed them conventionally until you get all twelve in one bird.  “Identifying which genes to target may be the hardest part, especially the behavioral genes.”\r\n\r\nIMG4871aComparative tail lengths: passenger pigeonDavid Blockstein commented than in captivity some pigeons can go from egg to next generation egg in as short as six months. Scott Edwards wondered if twelve gene changes might get you 80% of the way to a passenger pigeon, but it could take a thousand more to get you all the way.  Beth Shapiro asked, “What is the threshold for making a species a species?”  Jamie Shreeve suggested the term “proxy passenger pigeon” for the initial reconstructed bird.  It would not yet be totally identical genomically to the original passenger pigeon but may embody its most significant characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe group then went across a courtyard to the Wyss Institute to view Church’s spectacular hardware.  The first was the Polonator G007 from Dover, perched on a table like an airport-lounge coffee machine.  Church: “It’s basically a whole lab in a box.  You can read and write DNA.  You can do biochemistry.  You can do cell biology.”  In the next room was the current version of the MAGE'),

Getting more DNA samples from more passenger pigeon specimens would help.  The goal is a complete and annotated genome.  The cost of their passenger pigeon work so far (“not including person time”) has been about $10,000.  The cost of thoroughly sequencing the band-tailed pigeon (there are some in captivity) might be about $60,000, Shapiro concluded.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to restore revived passenger pigeons to the wild will have to operate with good knowledge about what elements led to their extinction in the first place, because those elements must be anticipated and overcome this time around, or there’s little hope.  (It may be that 21st-century genomic analysis and attempts to rewild the bird have the side-benefit of revealing the true causes of the original extinction.)\r\n\r\nDavid Blockstein probed the standard explanations of the precipitous decline of the bird population from billions to thousands in 25 years---massive hunting, habitat loss, mysterious disease---and he made the case for constrained reproduction.  The bird seemed to mate most successfully only in huge groups, and it laid a single egg on a flimsy, conspicuous nest.  Its ecological success may have depended too exclusively on “predator satiation”---overwhelming predators with sheer numbers---and when that was compromised, the rest of its defenses may have been too feeble.  “Once its population dropped below a certain level, the passenger pigeon may have been ecologically extinct long before the last birds died.”\r\n\r\nimagelarge4aPassenger pigeon nest and customary\r\nJoel Greenberg argued that the literature indicates that there were many small groups who nested successfully.  Even more than with their overwhelming numbers, the pigeons evaded predators (including Indians) by roosting, nesting, and feeding in different places every year.  Once Americans had the telegraph to spread the word about where the birds were massing each year, that former advantage turned into the pigeon’s greatest vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNoel Snyder drew on his decades of experience saving the California condor (22 birds left in 1987; 400 alive now, half of them back in the wild) to consider potential problems with captive breeding and release to the wild of reconstructed passenger pigeons.  “Politics can often overwhelm everything else that you’re trying to do.”  California condors are still not safe in the wild because gun enthusiasts refuse to use non-lead bullets, and the condors keep being poisoned by lead in carcasses that hunters leave.  The very problem that caused the near extinction of the bird has not been corrected.\r\n\r\nScott Edwards opined that the passenger pigeon may be a pretty good candidate for re-establishment in the wild.  It’s small enough to reproduce rapidly.  Being nomadic and irruptive (migrates in large numbers), it can find and occupy favorable habitats.  There are 309 species of pigeons, which suggests they adapt and speciate readily.  Much of the eastern deciduous forest has grown back since the 1880s, and commercial hunting has stopped.\r\n\r\nHank Greely addressed “the ethical, legal, and social issues that this project might raise.”  He thinks that quite different issues will arise in its two phases---1) recreating the passenger pigeon and 2) releasing it into the wild.  The issues with the first phase should be minor. “Some will think it’s wrong because they think we’re playing God.  Others will think it’s wrong because they think we’re usurping the deity they call Nature.”  Visceral reactions like that could come from both left and right. But any potential ecological risks from recreating the species don’t matter so long as it is kept in a controlled environment.  Some will worry that if you can revive extinct species, then you undercut efforts to keep endangered species from going extinct.  (A similar argument was made against seat belts in cars---people will feel invulnerable and drive more dangerously.)\r\n\r\nuntitled1The passenger pigeon’s famously alert,Once you consider releasing the birds, now the question is, what are the risks?  The habitat the bird was once native to has been replaced by different forests and many more people.  Will it cause eco-disruption?  Could it be a disease vector?  You may get political opposition from farmers or from hunters.  Would the bird have to go through the exhaustive bureaucratic process that GMO crops face?  (Is it really a transgenic organism?  All its genes are pigeon genes, edited precisely.)  The Environmental Protection Agency would get involved, and Environmental Impact Reports would be required.  One advantage of recreating the bird genetically and breeding it in captivity for years is that you would gain a lot of information to help manage its reintroduction to the wild.\r\n\r\nBrand proposed that, as the project chugs along, the public will have years to comprehend and discuss the prospects of bringing back an extinct species.  “This generation gets to rethink extinction, gets to rethink habitat loss and habitat restoration, and gets to ponder the role of biotechnology in protecting biodiversity.  Welcome to a very interesting century.”\r\n\r\nThe group finished by contemplating next steps.  Jamie Shreeve urged moving ahead on the proposed genetic technique to see if it works and how it can be improved.  Plans for a “Revive and Restore” conference in the Fall of 2012 were discussed---perhaps hosted by National Geographic, perhaps by Stanford. As for near-term public visibility of the proposed scheme to Bring Back the Passenger Pigeon (or other extinct species), the group agreed that everyone at the meeting should feel free to raise the subject with anyone while at the same time being careful to lower expectations.  The de-extinction idea is being explored; there are LOTS of reasons it may not work.\r\n\r\n--Stewart Brand (22 Feb 2012)\r\n\r\nFinancial report:  The cost of the meeting was about $10,000, mostly for travel and lodging, and was provided by Ryan Phelan.  The meeting room we owe to Harvard Medical School.'),

birds have 1.5 billion.)\r\n\r\nBandtail1Band-tailed pigeonThe closest relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata), which is common in the American west.  Church’s idea is to sequence both birds (there are hundreds of specimens of the passenger pigeon in museums), compare their genomes, and then gene by gene (trait by trait) transform the band-tailed genome into that of a passenger pigeon.\r\n\r\nFor example, a passenger pigeon has a much longer tail than a band-tailed pigeon.  Once you’ve found the genome sequence that determines the tail length, you replace that sequence in the band-tailed pigeon with the tail-length sequence from the passenger pigeon.  You take, say, twelve changes you want---a few for tail size, a few for color (red eye, peach-colored breast), a few that are behavioral---check that each set works in separate birds and then breed them conventionally until you get all twelve in one bird.  “Identifying which genes to target may be the hardest part, especially the behavioral genes.”\r\n\r\nIMG4871aComparative tail lengths: passenger pigeonDavid Blockstein commented than in captivity some pigeons can go from egg to next generation egg in as short as six months. Scott Edwards wondered if twelve gene changes might get you 80% of the way to a passenger pigeon, but it could take a thousand more to get you all the way.  Beth Shapiro asked, “What is the threshold for making a species a species?”  Jamie Shreeve suggested the term “proxy passenger pigeon” for the initial reconstructed bird.  It would not yet be totally identical genomically to the original passenger pigeon but may embody its most significant characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe group then went across a courtyard to the Wyss Institute to view Church’s spectacular hardware.  The first was the Polonator G007 from Dover, perched on a table like an airport-lounge coffee machine.  Church: “It’s basically a whole lab in a box.  You can read and write DNA.  You can do biochemistry.  You can do cell biology.”  In the next room was the current version of the MAGE');

birds have 1.5 billion.)\r\n\r\nBandtail1Band-tailed pigeonThe closest relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata), which is common in the American west.  Church’s idea is to sequence both birds (there are hundreds of specimens of the passenger pigeon in museums), compare their genomes, and then gene by gene (trait by trait) transform the band-tailed genome into that of a passenger pigeon.\r\n\r\nFor example, a passenger pigeon has a much longer tail than a band-tailed pigeon.  Once you’ve found the genome sequence that determines the tail length, you replace that sequence in the band-tailed pigeon with the tail-length sequence from the passenger pigeon.  You take, say, twelve changes you want---a few for tail size, a few for color (red eye, peach-colored breast), a few that are behavioral---check that each set works in separate birds and then breed them conventionally until you get all twelve in one bird.  “Identifying which genes to target may be the hardest part, especially the behavioral genes.”\r\n\r\nIMG4871aComparative tail lengths: passenger pigeonDavid Blockstein commented than in captivity some pigeons can go from egg to next generation egg in as short as six months. Scott Edwards wondered if twelve gene changes might get you 80% of the way to a passenger pigeon, but it could take a thousand more to get you all the way.  Beth Shapiro asked, “What is the threshold for making a species a species?”  Jamie Shreeve suggested the term “proxy passenger pigeon” for the initial reconstructed bird.  It would not yet be totally identical genomically to the original passenger pigeon but may embody its most significant characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe group then went across a courtyard to the Wyss Institute to view Church’s spectacular hardware.  The first was the Polonator G007 from Dover, perched on a table like an airport-lounge coffee machine.  Church: “It’s basically a whole lab in a box.  You can read and write DNA.  You can do biochemistry.  You can do cell biology.”  In the next room was the current version of the MAGE'),

birds have 1.5 billion.)\r\n\r\nBandtail1Band-tailed pigeonThe closest relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata), which is common in the American west.  Church’s idea is to sequence both birds (there are hundreds of specimens of the passenger pigeon in museums), compare their genomes, and then gene by gene (trait by trait) transform the band-tailed genome into that of a passenger pigeon.\r\n\r\nFor example, a passenger pigeon has a much longer tail than a band-tailed pigeon.  Once you’ve found the genome sequence that determines the tail length, you replace that sequence in the band-tailed pigeon with the tail-length sequence from the passenger pigeon.  You take, say, twelve changes you want---a few for tail size, a few for color (red eye, peach-colored breast), a few that are behavioral---check that each set works in separate birds and then breed them conventionally until you get all twelve in one bird.  “Identifying which genes to target may be the hardest part, especially the behavioral genes.”\r\n\r\nIMG4871aComparative tail lengths: passenger pigeonDavid Blockstein commented than in captivity some pigeons can go from egg to next generation egg in as short as six months. Scott Edwards wondered if twelve gene changes might get you 80% of the way to a passenger pigeon, but it could take a thousand more to get you all the way.  Beth Shapiro asked, “What is the threshold for making a species a species?”  Jamie Shreeve suggested the term “proxy passenger pigeon” for the initial reconstructed bird.  It would not yet be totally identical genomically to the original passenger pigeon but may embody its most significant characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe group then went across a courtyard to the Wyss Institute to view Church’s spectacular hardware.  The first was the Polonator G007 from Dover, perched on a table like an airport-lounge coffee machine.  Church: “It’s basically a whole lab in a box.  You can read and write DNA.  You can do biochemistry.  You can do cell biology.”  In the next room was the current version of the MAGE'),

birds have 1.5 billion.)\r\n\r\nBandtail1Band-tailed pigeonThe closest relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata), which is common in the American west.  Church’s idea is to sequence both birds (there are hundreds of specimens of the passenger pigeon in museums), compare their genomes, and then gene by gene (trait by trait) transform the band-tailed genome into that of a passenger pigeon.\r\n\r\nFor example, a passenger pigeon has a much longer tail than a band-tailed pigeon.  Once you’ve found the genome sequence that determines the tail length, you replace that sequence in the band-tailed pigeon with the tail-length sequence from the passenger pigeon.  You take, say, twelve changes you want---a few for tail size, a few for color (red eye, peach-colored breast), a few that are behavioral---check that each set works in separate birds and then breed them conventionally until you get all twelve in one bird.  “Identifying which genes to target may be the hardest part, especially the behavioral genes.”\r\n\r\nIMG4871aComparative tail lengths: passenger pigeonDavid Blockstein commented than in captivity some pigeons can go from egg to next generation egg in as short as six months. Scott Edwards wondered if twelve gene changes might get you 80% of the way to a passenger pigeon, but it could take a thousand more to get you all the way.  Beth Shapiro asked, “What is the threshold for making a species a species?”  Jamie Shreeve suggested the term “proxy passenger pigeon” for the initial reconstructed bird.  It would not yet be totally identical genomically to the original passenger pigeon but may embody its most significant characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe group then went across a courtyard to the Wyss Institute to view Church’s spectacular hardware.  The first was the Polonator G007 from Dover, perched on a table like an airport-lounge coffee machine.  Church: “It’s basically a whole lab in a box.  You can read and write DNA.  You can do biochemistry.  You can do cell biology.”  In the next room was the current version of the MAGE');

But any potential ecological risks from recreating the species don’t matter so long as it is kept in a controlled environment.  Some will worry that if you can revive extinct species, then you undercut efforts to keep endangered species from going extinct.  (A similar argument was made against seat belts in cars---people will feel invulnerable and drive more dangerously.)\r\n\r\nuntitled1The passenger pigeon’s famously alert,Once you consider releasing the birds, now the question is, what are the risks?  The habitat the bird was once native to has been replaced by different forests and many more people.  Will it cause eco-disruption?  Could it be a disease vector?  You may get political opposition from farmers or from hunters.  Would the bird have to go through the exhaustive bureaucratic process that GMO crops face?  (Is it really a transgenic organism?  All its genes are pigeon genes, edited precisely.)  The Environmental Protection Agency would get involved, and Environmental Impact Reports would be required.  One advantage of recreating the bird genetically and breeding it in captivity for years is that you would gain a lot of information to help manage its reintroduction to the wild.\r\n\r\nBrand proposed that, as the project chugs along, the public will have years to comprehend and discuss the prospects of bringing back an extinct species.  “This generation gets to rethink extinction, gets to rethink habitat loss and habitat restoration, and gets to ponder the role of biotechnology in protecting biodiversity.  Welcome to a very interesting century.”\r\n\r\nThe group finished by contemplating next steps.  Jamie Shreeve urged moving ahead on the proposed genetic technique to see if it works and how it can be improved.  Plans for a “Revive and Restore” conference in the Fall of 2012 were discussed---perhaps hosted by National Geographic, perhaps by Stanford. As for near-term public visibility of the proposed scheme to Bring Back the Passenger Pigeon (or other extinct species), the group agreed that everyone at the meeting should feel free to raise the subject with anyone while at the same time being careful to lower expectations.  The de-extinction idea is being explored; there are LOTS of reasons it may not work.\r\n\r\n--Stewart Brand (22 Feb 2012)\r\n\r\nFinancial report:  The cost of the meeting was about $10,000, mostly for travel and lodging, and was provided by Ryan Phelan.  The meeting room we owe to Harvard Medical School.'),

Getting more DNA samples from more passenger pigeon specimens would help.  The goal is a complete and annotated genome.  The cost of their passenger pigeon work so far (“not including person time”) has been about $10,000.  The cost of thoroughly sequencing the band-tailed pigeon (there are some in captivity) might be about $60,000, Shapiro concluded.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to restore revived passenger pigeons to the wild will have to operate with good knowledge about what elements led to their extinction in the first place, because those elements must be anticipated and overcome this time around, or there’s little hope.  (It may be that 21st-century genomic analysis and attempts to rewild the bird have the side-benefit of revealing the true causes of the original extinction.)\r\n\r\nDavid Blockstein probed the standard explanations of the precipitous decline of the bird population from billions to thousands in 25 years---massive hunting, habitat loss, mysterious disease---and he made the case for constrained reproduction.  The bird seemed to mate most successfully only in huge groups, and it laid a single egg on a flimsy, conspicuous nest.  Its ecological success may have depended too exclusively on “predator satiation”---overwhelming predators with sheer numbers---and when that was compromised, the rest of its defenses may have been too feeble.  “Once its population dropped below a certain level, the passenger pigeon may have been ecologically extinct long before the last birds died.”\r\n\r\nimagelarge4aPassenger pigeon nest and customary\r\nJoel Greenberg argued that the literature indicates that there were many small groups who nested successfully.  Even more than with their overwhelming numbers, the pigeons evaded predators (including Indians) by roosting, nesting, and feeding in different places every year.  Once Americans had the telegraph to spread the word about where the birds were massing each year, that former advantage turned into the pigeon’s greatest vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNoel Snyder drew on his decades of experience saving the California condor (22 birds left in 1987; 400 alive now, half of them back in the wild) to consider potential problems with captive breeding and release to the wild of reconstructed passenger pigeons.  “Politics can often overwhelm everything else that you’re trying to do.”  California condors are still not safe in the wild because gun enthusiasts refuse to use non-lead bullets, and the condors keep being poisoned by lead in carcasses that hunters leave.  The very problem that caused the near extinction of the bird has not been corrected.\r\n\r\nScott Edwards opined that the passenger pigeon may be a pretty good candidate for re-establishment in the wild.  It’s small enough to reproduce rapidly.  Being nomadic and irruptive (migrates in large numbers), it can find and occupy favorable habitats.  There are 309 species of pigeons, which suggests they adapt and speciate readily.  Much of the eastern deciduous forest has grown back since the 1880s, and commercial hunting has stopped.\r\n\r\nHank Greely addressed “the ethical, legal, and social issues that this project might raise.”  He thinks that quite different issues will arise in its two phases---1) recreating the passenger pigeon and 2) releasing it into the wild.  The issues with the first phase should be minor. “Some will think it’s wrong because they think we’re playing God.  Others will think it’s wrong because they think we’re usurping the deity they call Nature.”  Visceral reactions like that could come from both left and right. But any potential ecological risks from recreating the species don’t matter so long as it is kept in a controlled environment.  Some will worry that if you can revive extinct species, then you undercut efforts to keep endangered species from going extinct.  (A similar argument was made against seat belts in cars---people will feel invulnerable and drive more dangerously.)\r\n\r\nuntitled1The passenger pigeon’s famously alert,Once you consider releasing the birds, now the question is, what are the risks?  The habitat the bird was once native to has been replaced by different forests and many more people.  Will it cause eco-disruption?  Could it be a disease vector?  You may get political opposition from farmers or from hunters.  Would the bird have to go through the exhaustive bureaucratic process that GMO crops face?  (Is it really a transgenic organism?  All its genes are pigeon genes, edited precisely.)  The Environmental Protection Agency would get involved, and Environmental Impact Reports would be required.  One advantage of recreating the bird genetically and breeding it in captivity for years is that you would gain a lot of information to help manage its reintroduction to the wild.\r\n\r\nBrand proposed that, as the project chugs along, the public will have years to comprehend and discuss the prospects of bringing back an extinct species.  “This generation gets to rethink extinction, gets to rethink habitat loss and habitat restoration, and gets to ponder the role of biotechnology in protecting biodiversity.  Welcome to a very interesting century.”\r\n\r\nThe group finished by contemplating next steps.  Jamie Shreeve urged moving ahead on the proposed genetic technique to see if it works and how it can be improved.  Plans for a “Revive and Restore” conference in the Fall of 2012 were discussed---perhaps hosted by National Geographic, perhaps by Stanford.

birds have 1.5 billion.)\r\n\r\nBandtail1Band-tailed pigeonThe closest relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata), which is common in the American west.  Church’s idea is to sequence both birds (there are hundreds of specimens of the passenger pigeon in museums), compare their genomes, and then gene by gene (trait by trait) transform the band-tailed genome into that of a passenger pigeon.\r\n\r\nFor example, a passenger pigeon has a much longer tail than a band-tailed pigeon.  Once you’ve found the genome sequence that determines the tail length, you replace that sequence in the band-tailed pigeon with the tail-length sequence from the passenger pigeon.  You take, say, twelve changes you want---a few for tail size, a few for color (red eye, peach-colored breast), a few that are behavioral---check that each set works in separate birds and then breed them conventionally until you get all twelve in one bird.  “Identifying which genes to target may be the hardest part, especially the behavioral genes.”\r\n\r\nIMG4871aComparative tail lengths: passenger pigeonDavid Blockstein commented than in captivity some pigeons can go from egg to next generation egg in as short as six months. Scott Edwards wondered if twelve gene changes might get you 80% of the way to a passenger pigeon, but it could take a thousand more to get you all the way.  Beth Shapiro asked, “What is the threshold for making a species a species?”  Jamie Shreeve suggested the term “proxy passenger pigeon” for the initial reconstructed bird.  It would not yet be totally identical genomically to the original passenger pigeon but may embody its most significant characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe group then went across a courtyard to the Wyss Institute to view Church’s spectacular hardware.  The first was the Polonator G007 from Dover, perched on a table like an airport-lounge coffee machine.  Church: “It’s basically a whole lab in a box.  You can read and write DNA.  You can do biochemistry.  You can do cell biology.”  In the next room was the current version of the MAGE'),

But any potential ecological risks from recreating the species don’t matter so long as it is kept in a controlled environment.  Some will worry that if you can revive extinct species, then you undercut efforts to keep endangered species from going extinct.  (A similar argument was made against seat belts in cars---people will feel invulnerable and drive more dangerously.)\r\n\r\nuntitled1The passenger pigeon’s famously alert,Once you consider releasing the birds, now the question is, what are the risks?  The habitat the bird was once native to has been replaced by different forests and many more people.  Will it cause eco-disruption?  Could it be a disease vector?  You may get political opposition from farmers or from hunters.  Would the bird have to go through the exhaustive bureaucratic process that GMO crops face?  (Is it really a transgenic organism?  All its genes are pigeon genes, edited precisely.)  The Environmental Protection Agency would get involved, and Environmental Impact Reports would be required.  One advantage of recreating the bird genetically and breeding it in captivity for years is that you would gain a lot of information to help manage its reintroduction to the wild.\r\n\r\nBrand proposed that, as the project chugs along, the public will have years to comprehend and discuss the prospects of bringing back an extinct species.  “This generation gets to rethink extinction, gets to rethink habitat loss and habitat restoration, and gets to ponder the role of biotechnology in protecting biodiversity.  Welcome to a very interesting century.”\r\n\r\nThe group finished by contemplating next steps.  Jamie Shreeve urged moving ahead on the proposed genetic technique to see if it works and how it can be improved.  Plans for a “Revive and Restore” conference in the Fall of 2012 were discussed---perhaps hosted by National Geographic, perhaps by Stanford.

birds have 1.5 billion.)\r\n\r\nBandtail1Band-tailed pigeonThe closest relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata), which is common in the American west.  Church’s idea is to sequence both birds (there are hundreds of specimens of the passenger pigeon in museums), compare their genomes, and then gene by gene (trait by trait) transform the band-tailed genome into that of a passenger pigeon.\r\n\r\nFor example, a passenger pigeon has a much longer tail than a band-tailed pigeon.  Once you’ve found the genome sequence that determines the tail length, you replace that sequence in the band-tailed pigeon with the tail-length sequence from the passenger pigeon.  You take, say, twelve changes you want---a few for tail size, a few for color (red eye, peach-colored breast), a few that are behavioral---check that each set works in separate birds and then breed them conventionally until you get all twelve in one bird.  “Identifying which genes to target may be the hardest part, especially the behavioral genes.”\r\n\r\nIMG4871aComparative tail lengths: passenger pigeonDavid Blockstein commented than in captivity some pigeons can go from egg to next generation egg in as short as six months. Scott Edwards wondered if twelve gene changes might get you 80% of the way to a passenger pigeon, but it could take a thousand more to get you all the way.  Beth Shapiro asked, “What is the threshold for making a species a species?”  Jamie Shreeve suggested the term “proxy passenger pigeon” for the initial reconstructed bird.  It would not yet be totally identical genomically to the original passenger pigeon but may embody its most significant characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe group then went across a courtyard to the Wyss Institute to view Church’s spectacular hardware.  The first was the Polonator G007 from Dover, perched on a table like an airport-lounge coffee machine.  Church: “It’s basically a whole lab in a box.  You can read and write DNA.  You can do biochemistry.  You can do cell biology.”  In the next room was the current version of the MAGE');

It would be a valuable tool for everyone working in ancient DNA. It could build off the list of "species to bring back". I''m thinking of a full list of extinct species within the age range that DNA is viable to retrieve, with some information on collections housing tissue or fossil material, taxonomy information, and some references to literature. In this way a person designing an ancient DNA project could find out what species have no previous DNA sequenced, what species do, and to what extent.

Why do it? Why revive extinct species?</h2>\r\n\r\n    <p class="left-25">For the same reasons we protect endangered species. To preserve biodiveristy and genetic diversity. To undo harm that humans have caused in the past. To restore diminished ecosystems. To advance the science of preventing extinctions.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>2. Won’t reviving extinct species make people stop caring about protecting endangered species?</h2>\r\n\r\n    <p class="left-25">It is likely to make them care more. The costs and difficulty (maybe impossibility) are vastly greater for reversing extinction than for heading it off. Preventing extinction is hard enough; reversing extinction will be prohibitively expensive and maddeningly slow. In most cases, once a species is gone, it will stay gone. First protect the living.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>3. How soon will some extinct creature live again?</h2>\r\n\r\n    <p class="left-25">Signs are there will be some impressive milestones in this decade. Technically one extinction has already been partially reversed. The last Pyrenean ibex (also called a bucardo) died in 2000. A Spanish team used frozen tissue to clone a living twin in 2003, birthed by a goat. The baby ibex died of respiratory failure after seven minutes (a common problem in early cloning efforts). Funding dried up, so no further work has been done on this species as yet. As George Church reminds people, the first airplane flight in 1903 lasted 12 seconds.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <h2>4. If you bring the genome of a species back to life, are you really bringing the species back to life?</h2>\r\n    \r\n    <p class="left-25">That remains to be seen. It is one reason to do the research: is the genome the species? The answer will vary from species to species. De-extincted plants should flourish as if they’d never left, if suitable pollinators are still around. But if California condors had gone extinct, it’s unclear if they could be brought back fully, because the young rely on parental training. Passenger pigeons got no significant parental training, but can new ones function without a flock? Could young mammoths be reared successfully by a herd of elephants? Once something is returned to the wild, how much does the wild teach it?</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="span-10 last">\r\n    \r\n    <h1>Recommended reading</h1>\r\n\r\n    <p class="larger">EXTINCTION</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>NATURE’S GHOSTS: Confronting Extinction from the Age of Jefferson to the Age of Ecology</strong> - Mark V.

margin:7px" border="0" height="397" width="276"><span class="style57">The whole process is made easier by a device his lab built which writes&nbsp;and&nbsp;reads DNA. &nbsp;It allows you to correct&nbsp;your results as you go along. &nbsp;You can even note the effects on organisms on the slide and then select the ones&nbsp;you want. &nbsp;For larger organisms, this form of “genome editing” can be tested on cells and tissues before you go for&nbsp;a whole bird. &nbsp;There has already been some genome engineering with chickens, to make them resistant to avian&nbsp;influenza. &nbsp;Working with primordial germ cells, <img src="Resources/item6a.gif" alt="George Church’s “lab in a" style="float:left; margin:7px" border="0" height="53" width="265">you introduce the changes into the embryo in the egg---lots easier&nbsp;than trying to reach the embryo in a mammal. &nbsp;(Also the genome is simpler. &nbsp;Mice and humans have 3 billion base&nbsp;pairs;

&nbsp;Church figured that if you did&nbsp;twelve strains in parallel, each with twelve mutations (constructs), you get 144 mutations. &nbsp;It might cost $100,000&nbsp;per strain to get it into the bird. &nbsp;The whole process might take five years.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style57">Beth Shapiro reported on her experience sequencing “ancient DNA” from woolly mammoths, bison and horse&nbsp;bones, dodos, and passenger pigeons. &nbsp;Along with DNA reads from the target species you get contamination from&nbsp;creatures in the soil, things that colonize the bone, from people, and from mysterious sources. &nbsp;Of the reads they&nbsp;got from one well-preserved, frozen woolly mammoth, some 45% were “alignable” with current elephant DNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s considered very good. &nbsp;What other groups got from Neanderthals was only 0.1% - 2% alignable with&nbsp;primates.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style57">The genetic reads she got from passenger pigeon specimens are in between---about 25%, which is plenty to work&nbsp;with. &nbsp;Samples were taken from toe pads, the base of feathers, and muscle tissue, from nine specimens so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her research has focussed on traces of historic population dynamics discoverable in the genomes of animals such&nbsp;as bison. &nbsp;A reduction in genetic diversity would suggest that the population was getting smaller, potentially heading&nbsp;toward a bottleneck, and that crisis can be roughly dated. &nbsp;Studying nine specimens of passenger pigeons from the&nbsp;Royal Ontario Museum showed that they had very high genetic diversity.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style57">She now has a great many short reads from the passenger pigeon genome, but they have yet to be mapped&nbsp;against a similar living genome. &nbsp;Her group has been using the common rock pigeon. &nbsp;A band-tailed pigeon would be&nbsp;better. Getting more DNA samples from more passenger pigeon specimens would help. &nbsp;The goal is a complete&nbsp;and annotated genome. &nbsp;The cost of their passenger pigeon work so far (“not including person time”) has been&nbsp;about $10,000. &nbsp;The cost of thoroughly sequencing the band-tailed pigeon (there are some in captivity) might be&nbsp;about $60,000, Shapiro concluded.&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style57">Any attempt to restore revived passenger pigeons to the wild will have to operate with good knowledge about what&nbsp;elements led to their extinction in the first place, because those elements must be anticipated and overcome this&nbsp;time around, or there’s little hope. &nbsp;(It may be that 21st-century genomic analysis and attempts to rewild the bird&nbsp;have the side-benefit of revealing the true causes of the original extinction.)</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style57">David Blockstein probed the standard explanations of the precipitous decline of the bird population from billions to&nbsp;thousands in 25 years---massive hunting, habitat loss, mysterious disease---and he made the case for constrained&nbsp;reproduction. &nbsp;The bird seemed to mate most successfully only in huge groups, and it laid a single egg on a flimsy,&nbsp;conspicuous nest. &nbsp;Its ecological success may have depended too exclusively on “predator satiation”---overwhelming predators with sheer numbers---and when that was compromised, the rest of its defenses may have&nbsp;been too feeble. &nbsp;“Once its population dropped below a certain level, the passenger pigeon may have been&nbsp;ecologically extinct long before the last birds died.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p><img src="Resources/imagelarge4a.jpeg" alt="imagelarge4a" style="vertical-align:text-top; margin:5px" border="0" height="232" width="354"><img src="Resources/item4d.gif" alt="Passenger pigeon nest and customary" style="vertical-align:baseline; margin:5px" border="0" height="29" width="295"><span class="style57"><br>Joel Greenberg argued that the literature indicates that there were many small groups who nested successfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more than with their overwhelming numbers, the pigeons evaded predators (including Indians) by roosting,&nbsp;nesting, and feeding in different places every year. &nbsp;Once Americans had the telegraph to spread the word about&nbsp;where the birds were massing each year, that former advantage turned into the pigeon’s greatest vulnerability.&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style57">Noel Snyder drew on his decades of experience saving the California condor (22 birds left in 1987; 400 alive now,&nbsp;half of them back in the wild) to consider potential problems with captive breeding and release to the wild of&nbsp;reconstructed passenger pigeons. &nbsp;“Politics can often overwhelm everything else that you’re trying to do.”&nbsp;&nbsp;California condors are still not safe in the wild because gun enthusiasts refuse to use non-lead bullets, and the&nbsp;condors keep being poisoned by lead in carcasses that hunters leave. &nbsp;The very problem that caused the near&nbsp;extinction of the bird has not been corrected.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style57">Scott Edwards opined that the passenger pigeon may be a pretty good candidate for re-establishment in the wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s small enough to reproduce rapidly. &nbsp;Being nomadic and irruptive (migrates in large numbers), it can find and&nbsp;occupy favorable habitats. &nbsp;There are 309 species of pigeons, which suggests they adapt and speciate readily.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the eastern deciduous forest has grown back since the 1880s, and commercial hunting has stopped.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style57">Hank Greely addressed “the ethical, legal, and social issues that this project might raise.” &nbsp;He thinks that quite&nbsp;different issues will arise in its two phases---1) recreating the passenger pigeon and 2) releasing it into the wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues with the first phase should be minor. “Some will think it’s wrong because they think we’re playing God.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others will think it’s wrong because they think we’re usurping the deity they call Nature.” &nbsp;Visceral reactions like&nbsp;that could come from both left and right. But any potential ecological risks from recreating the species don’t matter&nbsp;so long as it is kept in a controlled environment. &nbsp;Some will worry that if you can revive extinct species, then you&nbsp;undercut efforts to keep endangered species from going extinct. &nbsp;(A similar argument was made against seat belts&nbsp;in cars---people will feel invulnerable and drive more dangerously.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p><a href="http://www.joelsartore.com/stock/BIR033-00327/?search=passenger%20pigeon&amp;sequence=7&amp;num=100"><img src="Resources/untitled1.jpeg" alt="untitled1" style="float:right; margin:7px" border="0" height="462" width="273"></a><img src="Resources/item4e.gif" alt="The passenger pigeon’s famously alert," usemap="#map2" style="float:right; margin:7px" border="0" height="50" width="271"><span class="style57">Once you consider releasing the birds, now the question is, what are the risks? &nbsp;The habitat the bird was once&nbsp;native to has been replaced by different forests and many more people. &nbsp;Will it cause eco-disruption? &nbsp;Could it be a&nbsp;disease vector? &nbsp;You may get political opposition from farmers or from hunters. &nbsp;Would the bird have to go through&nbsp;the exhaustive bureaucratic process that GMO crops face? &nbsp;(Is it really a transgenic organism? &nbsp;All its genes are&nbsp;pigeon genes, edited precisely.) &nbsp;The Environmental Protection Agency would get involved, and Environmental&nbsp;Impact Reports would be required. &nbsp;One advantage of recreating the bird genetically and breeding it in captivity for&nbsp;years is that you would gain a lot of information to help manage its reintroduction to the wild.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style57">Brand proposed that, as the project chugs along, the public will have years to comprehend and discuss the&nbsp;prospects of bringing back an extinct species. &nbsp;“This generation gets to rethink extinction, gets to rethink habitat&nbsp;loss and habitat restoration, and gets to ponder the role of biotechnology in protecting biodiversity. &nbsp;Welcome to a&nbsp;very interesting century.”</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style57">The group finished by contemplating next steps. &nbsp;Jamie Shreeve urged moving ahead on the proposed genetic&nbsp;technique to see if it works and how it can be improved. &nbsp;Plans for a “Revive and Restore” conference in the Fall of&nbsp;2012 were discussed---perhaps hosted by National Geographic, perhaps by Stanford. As for near-term public&nbsp;visibility of the proposed scheme to Bring Back the Passenger Pigeon (or other extinct species), the group agreed&nbsp;that everyone at the meeting should feel free to raise the subject with anyone while at the same time being careful&nbsp;to lower expectations. &nbsp;The de-extinction idea is being explored; there are LOTS of reasons it may not work.</span></p>\n						<p class="style58">--Stewart Brand (22 Feb 2012)</p>\n						<p class="f-lp"><span class="style57">&nbsp;Financial report: &nbsp;The cost of the meeting was about $10,000, mostly for travel and lodging, and was provided&nbsp;by Ryan Phelan. &nbsp;The meeting room we owe to Harvard Medical School.</span></p>\n						</td>\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3c.png)" height="3387" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\n					</tr>\n					<tr valign="top">\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3e.png)" height="14" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3a.png)" height="14" width="466"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3f.png)" height="14" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\n					</tr>\n				</tbody></table>', 'Passenger Pigeon Workshop', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '36-revision-2', '', '', '2013-01-17 17:23:47', '2013-01-17 17:23:47', '', 36, 'http://rare.sansink.com/36-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Getting more DNA samples from more passenger pigeon specimens would help. &nbsp;The goal is a complete&nbsp;and annotated genome. &nbsp;The cost of their passenger pigeon work so far (“not including person time”) has been&nbsp;about $10,000. &nbsp;The cost of thoroughly sequencing the band-tailed pigeon (there are some in captivity) might be&nbsp;about $60,000, Shapiro concluded.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">Any attempt to restore revived passenger pigeons to the wild will have to operate with good knowledge about what&nbsp;elements led to their extinction in the first place, because those elements must be anticipated and overcome this&nbsp;time around, or there’s little hope. &nbsp;(It may be that 21st-century genomic analysis and attempts to rewild the bird&nbsp;have the side-benefit of revealing the true causes of the original extinction.)</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">David Blockstein probed the standard explanations of the precipitous decline of the bird population from billions to&nbsp;thousands in 25 years---massive hunting, habitat loss, mysterious disease---and he made the case for constrained&nbsp;reproduction. &nbsp;The bird seemed to mate most successfully only in huge groups, and it laid a single egg on a flimsy,&nbsp;conspicuous nest. &nbsp;Its ecological success may have depended too exclusively on “predator satiation”---overwhelming predators with sheer numbers---and when that was compromised, the rest of its defenses may have&nbsp;been too feeble. &nbsp;“Once its population dropped below a certain level, the passenger pigeon may have been&nbsp;ecologically extinct long before the last birds died.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p><img src="Resources/imagelarge4a.jpeg" alt="imagelarge4a" style="vertical-align:text-top; margin:5px" border="0" height="232" width="354"><img src="Resources/item4d.gif" alt="Passenger pigeon nest and customary" style="vertical-align:baseline; margin:5px" border="0" height="29" width="295"><span class="style57"><br>Joel Greenberg argued that the literature indicates that there were many small groups who nested successfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more than with their overwhelming numbers, the pigeons evaded predators (including Indians) by roosting,&nbsp;nesting, and feeding in different places every year. &nbsp;Once Americans had the telegraph to spread the word about&nbsp;where the birds were massing each year, that former advantage turned into the pigeon’s greatest vulnerability.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">Noel Snyder drew on his decades of experience saving the California condor (22 birds left in 1987; 400 alive now,&nbsp;half of them back in the wild) to consider potential problems with captive breeding and release to the wild of&nbsp;reconstructed passenger pigeons. &nbsp;“Politics can often overwhelm everything else that you’re trying to do.”&nbsp;&nbsp;California condors are still not safe in the wild because gun enthusiasts refuse to use non-lead bullets, and the&nbsp;condors keep being poisoned by lead in carcasses that hunters leave. &nbsp;The very problem that caused the near&nbsp;extinction of the bird has not been corrected.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">Scott Edwards opined that the passenger pigeon may be a pretty good candidate for re-establishment in the wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s small enough to reproduce rapidly. &nbsp;Being nomadic and irruptive (migrates in large numbers), it can find and&nbsp;occupy favorable habitats. &nbsp;There are 309 species of pigeons, which suggests they adapt and speciate readily.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the eastern deciduous forest has grown back since the 1880s, and commercial hunting has stopped.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">Hank Greely addressed “the ethical, legal, and social issues that this project might raise.” &nbsp;He thinks that quite&nbsp;different issues will arise in its two phases---1) recreating the passenger pigeon and 2) releasing it into the wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues with the first phase should be minor. “Some will think it’s wrong because they think we’re playing God.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others will think it’s wrong because they think we’re usurping the deity they call Nature.” &nbsp;Visceral reactions like&nbsp;that could come from both left and right. But any potential ecological risks from recreating the species don’t matter&nbsp;so long as it is kept in a controlled environment. &nbsp;Some will worry that if you can revive extinct species, then you&nbsp;undercut efforts to keep endangered species from going extinct. &nbsp;(A similar argument was made against seat belts&nbsp;in cars---people will feel invulnerable and drive more dangerously.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p><a href="http://www.joelsartore.com/stock/BIR033-00327/?search=passenger%20pigeon&amp;sequence=7&amp;num=100"><img src="Resources/untitled1.jpeg" alt="untitled1" style="float:right; margin:7px" border="0" height="462" width="273"></a><img src="Resources/item4e.gif" alt="The passenger pigeon’s famously alert," usemap="#map2" style="float:right; margin:7px" border="0" height="50" width="271"><span class="style57">Once you consider releasing the birds, now the question is, what are the risks? &nbsp;The habitat the bird was once&nbsp;native to has been replaced by different forests and many more people. &nbsp;Will it cause eco-disruption? &nbsp;Could it be a&nbsp;disease vector? &nbsp;You may get political opposition from farmers or from hunters. &nbsp;Would the bird have to go through&nbsp;the exhaustive bureaucratic process that GMO crops face? &nbsp;(Is it really a transgenic organism? &nbsp;All its genes are&nbsp;pigeon genes, edited precisely.) &nbsp;The Environmental Protection Agency would get involved, and Environmental&nbsp;Impact Reports would be required. &nbsp;One advantage of recreating the bird genetically and breeding it in captivity for&nbsp;years is that you would gain a lot of information to help manage its reintroduction to the wild.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">Brand proposed that, as the project chugs along, the public will have years to comprehend and discuss the&nbsp;prospects of bringing back an extinct species. &nbsp;“This generation gets to rethink extinction, gets to rethink habitat&nbsp;loss and habitat restoration, and gets to ponder the role of biotechnology in protecting biodiversity. &nbsp;Welcome to a&nbsp;very interesting century.”</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">The group finished by contemplating next steps. &nbsp;Jamie Shreeve urged moving ahead on the proposed genetic&nbsp;technique to see if it works and how it can be improved. &nbsp;Plans for a “Revive and Restore” conference in the Fall of&nbsp;2012 were discussed---perhaps hosted by National Geographic, perhaps by Stanford. As for near-term public&nbsp;visibility of the proposed scheme to Bring Back the Passenger Pigeon (or other extinct species), the group agreed&nbsp;that everyone at the meeting should feel free to raise the subject with anyone while at the same time being careful&nbsp;to lower expectations. &nbsp;The de-extinction idea is being explored; there are LOTS of reasons it may not work.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style58">--Stewart Brand (22 Feb 2012)</p>\r\n						<p class="f-lp"><span class="style57">&nbsp;Financial report: &nbsp;The cost of the meeting was about $10,000, mostly for travel and lodging, and was provided&nbsp;by Ryan Phelan. &nbsp;The meeting room we owe to Harvard Medical School.</span></p>\r\n						</td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3c.png)" height="3387" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n					<tr valign="top">\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3e.png)" height="14" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3a.png)" height="14" width="466"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3f.png)" height="14" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n				</tbody></table>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td height="3413"></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr valign="top">\r\n			<td colspan="2" height="2"></td>\r\n			<td height="2"></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr class="f-sp">\r\n			<td><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="494"></td>\r\n			<td><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="12"></td>\r\n			<td><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="494"></td>\r\n			<td height="1"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody></table>', 'Passenger Pigeon Workshop', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '36-revision-3', '', '', '2013-01-17 17:24:27', '2013-01-17 17:24:27', '', 36, 'http://rare.sansink.com/36-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Technically one extinction has already been partially reversed.  The last Pyrenean ibex (also called a bucardo) died in 2000.  A Spanish team used frozen tissue to clone a living twin in 2003, birthed by a goat.  The baby ibex died of respiratory failure after seven minutes (a common problem in early cloning efforts).

It is one reason to do the research: <em>is</em> the genome the species?  The answer will vary from species to species.  De-extincted plants should flourish as if they&#8217;d never left, if suitable pollinators are still around.  But if California condors had gone extinct, it&#8217;s unclear if they could be brought back fully, because the young rely on parental training.  Passenger pigeons got no significant parental training, but can new ones function without a flock?  Could young mammoths be reared successfully by a herd of elephants?

To preserve biodiveristy and genetic diversity. To undo harm that humans have caused in the past. To restore diminished ecosystems. To advance the science of preventing extinctions.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Won’t reviving extinct species make people stop caring about protecting endangered species?</h2>\r\n<p>It is likely to make them care more. The costs and difficulty (maybe impossibility) are vastly greater for reversing extinction than for heading it off. Preventing extinction is hard enough; reversing extinction will be prohibitively expensive and maddeningly slow. In most cases, once a species is gone, it will stay gone. First protect the living.</p>\r\n<h2>3. How soon will some extinct creature live again?</h2>\r\n<p>Signs are there will be some impressive milestones in this decade. Technically one extinction has already been partially reversed. The last Pyrenean ibex (also called a bucardo) died in 2000. A Spanish team used frozen tissue to clone a living twin in 2003, birthed by a goat. The baby ibex died of respiratory failure after seven minutes (a common problem in early cloning efforts). Funding dried up, so no further work has been done on this species as yet. As George Church reminds people, the first airplane flight in 1903 lasted 12 seconds.</p>\r\n<h2>4. If you bring the genome of a species back to life, are you really bringing the species back to life?</h2>\r\n<p>That remains to be seen. It is one reason to do the research: is the genome the species? The answer will vary from species to species. De-extincted plants should flourish as if they’d never left, if suitable pollinators are still around. But if California condors had gone extinct, it’s unclear if they could be brought back fully, because the young rely on parental training. Passenger pigeons got no significant parental training, but can new ones function without a flock? Could young mammoths be reared successfully by a herd of elephants? Once something is returned to the wild, how much does the wild teach it?</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p>EXTINCTION</p>\r\n<p><strong>NATURE’S GHOSTS: Confronting Extinction from the Age of Jefferson to the Age of Ecology</strong> &#8211; Mark V.

To preserve biodiveristy and genetic diversity. To undo harm that humans have caused in the past. To restore diminished ecosystems. To advance the science of preventing extinctions.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Won’t reviving extinct species make people stop caring about protecting endangered species?</h2>\r\n<p>It is likely to make them care more. The costs and difficulty (maybe impossibility) are vastly greater for reversing extinction than for heading it off. Preventing extinction is hard enough; reversing extinction will be prohibitively expensive and maddeningly slow. In most cases, once a species is gone, it will stay gone. First protect the living.</p>\r\n<h2>3. How soon will some extinct creature live again?</h2>\r\n<p>Signs are there will be some impressive milestones in this decade. Technically one extinction has already been partially reversed. The last Pyrenean ibex (also called a bucardo) died in 2000. A Spanish team used frozen tissue to clone a living twin in 2003, birthed by a goat. The baby ibex died of respiratory failure after seven minutes (a common problem in early cloning efforts). Funding dried up, so no further work has been done on this species as yet. As George Church reminds people, the first airplane flight in 1903 lasted 12 seconds.</p>\r\n<h2>4. If you bring the genome of a species back to life, are you really bringing the species back to life?</h2>\r\n<p>That remains to be seen. It is one reason to do the research: is the genome the species? The answer will vary from species to species. De-extincted plants should flourish as if they’d never left, if suitable pollinators are still around. But if California condors had gone extinct, it’s unclear if they could be brought back fully, because the young rely on parental training. Passenger pigeons got no significant parental training, but can new ones function without a flock? Could young mammoths be reared successfully by a herd of elephants? Once something is returned to the wild, how much does the wild teach it?</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class="span 10 last">\r\n    \r\n<p>EXTINCTION</p>\r\n<p><strong>NATURE’S GHOSTS: Confronting Extinction from the Age of Jefferson to the Age of Ecology</strong> &#8211; Mark V.

Scott Edwards wondered if twelve gene changes might get you 80% of the way to a passenger pigeon,&nbsp;but it could take a thousand more to get you all the way. &nbsp;Beth Shapiro asked, “What is the threshold for making a&nbsp;species a species?” &nbsp;Jamie Shreeve suggested the term “proxy passenger pigeon” for the initial reconstructed bird.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not yet be totally identical genomically to the original passenger pigeon but may embody its most&nbsp;significant characteristics.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">The group then went across a courtyard to the Wyss Institute to view Church’s spectacular hardware. &nbsp;The first was&nbsp;the Polonator G007 from Dover, perched on a table like an airport-lounge coffee machine. &nbsp;Church: “It’s basically a&nbsp;whole lab in a box. &nbsp;You can read and write DNA. &nbsp;You can do biochemistry. &nbsp;You can do cell biology.” &nbsp;In the next&nbsp;room was the current version of the MAGE</span></p>\r\n						</td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3c.png)" height="3387" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n					<tr valign="top">\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3e.png)" height="14" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3a.png)" height="14" width="466"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3f.png)" height="14" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n				</tbody></table>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td colspan="2" height="2"></td>\r\n			<td height="2"></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr valign="top">\r\n			<td height="3413"></td>\r\n			<td rowspan="2" height="3415">\r\n				<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="494">\r\n					<colgroup>\r\n						<col width="14">\r\n						<col width="466">\r\n						<col width="14">\r\n					</colgroup>\r\n					<tbody><tr valign="top">\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3.png)" height="14" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3a.png)" height="14" width="466"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3b.png)" height="14" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n					<tr valign="top">\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3c.png)" height="3387" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3d.png)" height="3387" width="466"><p class="f-fp"><span class="style57">machine, the size of a kitchen refrigerator on its side. &nbsp;“You can make&nbsp;up to a billion genomes a day for combinatorial exploration.“</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">What would be the cost these days of building a passenger pigeon genomically? &nbsp;Church figured that if you did&nbsp;twelve strains in parallel, each with twelve mutations (constructs), you get 144 mutations. &nbsp;It might cost $100,000&nbsp;per strain to get it into the bird. &nbsp;The whole process might take five years.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">Beth Shapiro reported on her experience sequencing “ancient DNA” from woolly mammoths, bison and horse&nbsp;bones, dodos, and passenger pigeons. &nbsp;Along with DNA reads from the target species you get contamination from&nbsp;creatures in the soil, things that colonize the bone, from people, and from mysterious sources. &nbsp;Of the reads they&nbsp;got from one well-preserved, frozen woolly mammoth, some 45% were “alignable” with current elephant DNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s considered very good. &nbsp;What other groups got from Neanderthals was only 0.1% - 2% alignable with&nbsp;primates.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">The genetic reads she got from passenger pigeon specimens are in between---about 25%, which is plenty to work&nbsp;with. &nbsp;Samples were taken from toe pads, the base of feathers, and muscle tissue, from nine specimens so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her research has focussed on traces of historic population dynamics discoverable in the genomes of animals such&nbsp;as bison. &nbsp;A reduction in genetic diversity would suggest that the population was getting smaller, potentially heading&nbsp;toward a bottleneck, and that crisis can be roughly dated. &nbsp;Studying nine specimens of passenger pigeons from the&nbsp;Royal Ontario Museum showed that they had very high genetic diversity.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">She now has a great many short reads from the passenger pigeon genome, but they have yet to be mapped&nbsp;against a similar living genome. &nbsp;Her group has been using the common rock pigeon. &nbsp;A band-tailed pigeon would be&nbsp;better. Getting more DNA samples from more passenger pigeon specimens would help. &nbsp;The goal is a complete&nbsp;and annotated genome. &nbsp;The cost of their passenger pigeon work so far (“not including person time”) has been&nbsp;about $10,000. &nbsp;The cost of thoroughly sequencing the band-tailed pigeon (there are some in captivity) might be&nbsp;about $60,000, Shapiro concluded.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">Any attempt to restore revived passenger pigeons to the wild will have to operate with good knowledge about what&nbsp;elements led to their extinction in the first place, because those elements must be anticipated and overcome this&nbsp;time around, or there’s little hope. &nbsp;(It may be that 21st-century genomic analysis and attempts to rewild the bird&nbsp;have the side-benefit of revealing the true causes of the original extinction.)</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">David Blockstein probed the standard explanations of the precipitous decline of the bird population from billions to&nbsp;thousands in 25 years---massive hunting, habitat loss, mysterious disease---and he made the case for constrained&nbsp;reproduction. &nbsp;The bird seemed to mate most successfully only in huge groups, and it laid a single egg on a flimsy,&nbsp;conspicuous nest. &nbsp;Its ecological success may have depended too exclusively on “predator satiation”---overwhelming predators with sheer numbers---and when that was compromised, the rest of its defenses may have&nbsp;been too feeble. &nbsp;“Once its population dropped below a certain level, the passenger pigeon may have been&nbsp;ecologically extinct long before the last birds died.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p><img src="Resources/imagelarge4a.jpeg" alt="imagelarge4a" style="vertical-align:text-top; margin:5px" border="0" height="232" width="354"><img src="Resources/item4d.gif" alt="Passenger pigeon nest and customary" style="vertical-align:baseline; margin:5px" border="0" height="29" width="295"><span class="style57"><br>Joel Greenberg argued that the literature indicates that there were many small groups who nested successfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more than with their overwhelming numbers, the pigeons evaded predators (including Indians) by roosting,&nbsp;nesting, and feeding in different places every year. &nbsp;Once Americans had the telegraph to spread the word about&nbsp;where the birds were massing each year, that former advantage turned into the pigeon’s greatest vulnerability.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">Noel Snyder drew on his decades of experience saving the California condor (22 birds left in 1987; 400 alive now,&nbsp;half of them back in the wild) to consider potential problems with captive breeding and release to the wild of&nbsp;reconstructed passenger pigeons. &nbsp;“Politics can often overwhelm everything else that you’re trying to do.”&nbsp;&nbsp;California condors are still not safe in the wild because gun enthusiasts refuse to use non-lead bullets, and the&nbsp;condors keep being poisoned by lead in carcasses that hunters leave. &nbsp;The very problem that caused the near&nbsp;extinction of the bird has not been corrected.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">Scott Edwards opined that the passenger pigeon may be a pretty good candidate for re-establishment in the wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s small enough to reproduce rapidly. &nbsp;Being nomadic and irruptive (migrates in large numbers), it can find and&nbsp;occupy favorable habitats. &nbsp;There are 309 species of pigeons, which suggests they adapt and speciate readily.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the eastern deciduous forest has grown back since the 1880s, and commercial hunting has stopped.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">Hank Greely addressed “the ethical, legal, and social issues that this project might raise.” &nbsp;He thinks that quite&nbsp;different issues will arise in its two phases---1) recreating the passenger pigeon and 2) releasing it into the wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues with the first phase should be minor. “Some will think it’s wrong because they think we’re playing God.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others will think it’s wrong because they think we’re usurping the deity they call Nature.” &nbsp;Visceral reactions like&nbsp;that could come from both left and right. But any potential ecological risks from recreating the species don’t matter&nbsp;so long as it is kept in a controlled environment. &nbsp;Some will worry that if you can revive extinct species, then you&nbsp;undercut efforts to keep endangered species from going extinct. &nbsp;(A similar argument was made against seat belts&nbsp;in cars---people will feel invulnerable and drive more dangerously.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p><a href="http://www.joelsartore.com/stock/BIR033-00327/?search=passenger%20pigeon&amp;sequence=7&amp;num=100"><img src="Resources/untitled1.jpeg" alt="untitled1" style="float:right; margin:7px" border="0" height="462" width="273"></a><img src="Resources/item4e.gif" alt="The passenger pigeon’s famously alert," usemap="#map2" style="float:right; margin:7px" border="0" height="50" width="271"><span class="style57">Once you consider releasing the birds, now the question is, what are the risks? &nbsp;The habitat the bird was once&nbsp;native to has been replaced by different forests and many more people. &nbsp;Will it cause eco-disruption? &nbsp;Could it be a&nbsp;disease vector? &nbsp;You may get political opposition from farmers or from hunters. &nbsp;Would the bird have to go through&nbsp;the exhaustive bureaucratic process that GMO crops face? &nbsp;(Is it really a transgenic organism? &nbsp;All its genes are&nbsp;pigeon genes, edited precisely.) &nbsp;The Environmental Protection Agency would get involved, and Environmental&nbsp;Impact Reports would be required. &nbsp;One advantage of recreating the bird genetically and breeding it in captivity for&nbsp;years is that you would gain a lot of information to help manage its reintroduction to the wild.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">Brand proposed that, as the project chugs along, the public will have years to comprehend and discuss the&nbsp;prospects of bringing back an extinct species. &nbsp;“This generation gets to rethink extinction, gets to rethink habitat&nbsp;loss and habitat restoration, and gets to ponder the role of biotechnology in protecting biodiversity. &nbsp;Welcome to a&nbsp;very interesting century.”</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style57">The group finished by contemplating next steps. &nbsp;Jamie Shreeve urged moving ahead on the proposed genetic&nbsp;technique to see if it works and how it can be improved. &nbsp;Plans for a “Revive and Restore” conference in the Fall of&nbsp;2012 were discussed---perhaps hosted by National Geographic, perhaps by Stanford. As for near-term public&nbsp;visibility of the proposed scheme to Bring Back the Passenger Pigeon (or other extinct species), the group agreed&nbsp;that everyone at the meeting should feel free to raise the subject with anyone while at the same time being careful&nbsp;to lower expectations. &nbsp;The de-extinction idea is being explored; there are LOTS of reasons it may not work.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style58">--Stewart Brand (22 Feb 2012)</p>\r\n						<p class="f-lp"><span class="style57">&nbsp;Financial report: &nbsp;The cost of the meeting was about $10,000, mostly for travel and lodging, and was provided&nbsp;by Ryan Phelan. &nbsp;The meeting room we owe to Harvard Medical School.</span></p>\r\n						</td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3c.png)" height="3387" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n					<tr valign="top">\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3e.png)" height="14" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3a.png)" height="14" width="466"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n						<td style="background-image:url(Resources/item3f.png)" height="14" width="14"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n				</tbody></table>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td height="3413"></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr valign="top">\r\n			<td colspan="2" height="2"></td>\r\n			<td height="2"></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr class="f-sp">\r\n			<td><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="494"></td>\r\n			<td><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="12"></td>\r\n			<td><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="494"></td>\r\n			<td height="1"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" alt="" style="float:left" border="0" height="1" width="1"></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody></table>', 'Passenger Pigeon Workshop', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '36-revision-4', '', '', '2013-01-17 17:25:59', '2013-01-17 17:25:59', '', 36, 'http://rare.sansink.com/uncategorized/2013/36-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.</span>\n\n<span class="style121">Toward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:</span>\n<ul>\n	<li><span class="style121"> De-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\n</span></li>\n	<li><span class="style121"> It''s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\n</span></li>\n	<li><span class="style121"> Research on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\n</span></li>\n	<li><span class="style121"> Mutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\n</span></li>\n	<li><span class="style121"> Priority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\n</span></li>\n	<li><span class="style121"> De-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\n</span></li>\n	<li><span class="style121"> To deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\n</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul type="disc">\n	<li><span class="style121"> well-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\n</span></li>\n	<li><span class="style121"> regular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\n</span></li>\n	<li><span class="style121"> This level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span class="style121">To open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\n</span>\n\n<p class="style119">Successes with cloning</p>\n<p class="style194"><span class="style125"> • To begin the first session, </span><span class="style181">Alberto Fernández-Arias</span><span class="style182"> reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.</span></p>\n<span class="style182">In 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.</span>\n\n<span class="style182">Unfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.</span>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style182"> • The Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. </span><span class="style181">Oliver Ryder</span><span class="style182"> said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).</span></p>\n<span class="style182">The Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.</span>\n\n<span class="style182">Now that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill. </span>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style182"> • </span><span class="style181">Robert Lanza</span><span class="style182"> focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome. </span></p>\n<span class="style182">Thirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.</span>\n\n<span class="style182">As for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\n</span>\n<p class="style119">Some projects underway</p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style125"> • The aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said </span><span class="style183">Henri Kerkdijk-Otten</span><span class="style184">. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.</span></p>\n<span class="style184">The species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.</span>\n\n<span class="style184">The project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.</span>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • The most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. </span><span class="style183">Insung Hwang</span><span class="style184"> gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.</span></p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184">• Also off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. </span><span class="style183">Michael Archer</span><span class="style184"> and </span><span class="style183">David French</span><span class="style184"> described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species</span></p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • One reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, </span><span class="style183">Michael Archer</span><span class="style184"> explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement. </span></p>\n<span class="style184">If the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.</span>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184">• One remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by </span><span class="style183">Marilyn Renfree</span><span class="style185">. </span><span class="style184">The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation</span><span class="style185"> (Col2a1</span><span class="style186">) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal. </span></p>\n<span class="style186">One of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\n</span>\n<p class="style187">Emerging genomic techniques</p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • </span><span class="style183">George Church</span><span class="style184"> began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.</span></p>\n<span class="style184">Church’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.</span>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • Revive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by </span><span class="style183">Ben Novak</span><span class="style184">. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.</span></p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • According to </span><span class="style183">Michael McGrew</span><span class="style184">, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.</span></p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • Noting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential,</span><span class="style183"> Jean-Marie Rouillard</span><span class="style184"> said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity. </span></p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • The world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, </span><span class="style181">Guojie Zhang</span><span class="style182"> noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\n</span></p>\n<p class="style187"> Interpreting extinct molecules\n\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • DNA is a fragile molecule, said </span><span class="style183">Tom Gilbert</span><span class="style184">, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)</span></p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • No DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but </span><span class="style183">Mary Schweitzer</span><span class="style184"> showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones. </span></p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • As an alternative to PCR techniques, said </span><span class="style183">Michi Hofreiter</span><span class="style184">, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.</span></p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • Studying mammoth ancient DNA, </span><span class="style183">Hendrik Poinar</span><span class="style184"> explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\n</span></p>\n<p class="style187">Reviving extinct ecosystems</p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • Vast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said </span><span class="style183">Sergey Zimov</span><span class="style184">, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.</span></p>\n<span class="style184">Zimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.</span>\n\n<span class="style184">Zimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”</span>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • </span><span class="style183">Frans Vera</span><span class="style184"> also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.</span></p>\n<span class="style184">Huge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.</span>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • The use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in </span><span class="style183">David Burney</span><span class="style184">’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.</span></p>\n<span class="style184">Hundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.</span>\n\n<span class="style184">Burney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago). </span>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> • America’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. </span><span class="style189">William Powell</span><span class="style186"> explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.</span></p>\n<span class="style186">Powell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\n</span>\n<p class="style195 f-lp">[Continued next column]</p>\n</td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4c.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="4" height="5628"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign="top">\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4e.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="4" height="4"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4a.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="482" height="4"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4f.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="4" height="4"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td colspan="3" height="117"></td>\n<td height="117">\n<table width="312" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><colgroup> <col width="14" /> <col width="284" /> <col width="14" /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr valign="top">\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2a.png'');" width="284" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2b.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign="top">\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2c.png'');" width="14" height="89"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2fd.png'');" width="284" height="89">\n<p class="style132 f-lp"><strong>FORWARD TO THE PAST</strong><span class="style71"><strong><span class="style40">\nLinks</span></strong>\n</span><span class="style5"><a href="octbios.html">Participant bio‘s</a>\n<a href="octreading.html">Recommended reading</a>\nThe <a href="ppworshop.html">passenger pigeon meeting </a> at Harvard</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2c.png'');" width="14" height="89"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign="top">\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2d.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2a.png'');" width="284" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2e.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n<td height="117"></td>\n<td height="117"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign="top">\n<td colspan="5" height="13"></td>\n<td height="13"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign="top">\n<td height="1556"></td>\n<td colspan="4" height="1556">\n<table width="489" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><colgroup> <col width="14" /> <col width="461" /> <col width="14" /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr valign="top">\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1a.png'');" width="461" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1b.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr valign="top">\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1c.png'');" width="14" height="1528"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1d.png'');" width="461" height="1528"><span class="style40">Participants</span>\n<p class="style143 f-lp"><strong>Michael Archer</strong>, Professor Biological, Earth &amp;

The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.</span></p>\n<span class="style165">Nature</span><span class="style168"> magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?” </span>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style150"> • </span><span class="style189">Kate Jones</span><span class="style186"> said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)</span></p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> • </span><span class="style189">Peter Kareiva</span><span class="style186"> noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.</span></p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> • </span><span class="style189">Stanley Temple</span><span class="style186"> said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated. </span></p>\n<span class="style186">In the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They </span><span class="style190">want</span><span class="style186"> the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\n</span>\n<p class="style187">De-extinction ethics</p>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • The “ethics panel,” </span><span class="style183">Hank Greely</span><span class="style184"> pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. </span><span class="style183">Hillary Bok</span><span class="style184"> urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. </span><span class="style183">Alejandro Camacho</span><span class="style184"> said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited. </span></p>\n<span class="style183">Jacob Sherkow</span><span class="style184"> raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. </span><span class="style183">Nathan Wolfe</span><span class="style184"> suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.</span>\n\n<span class="style184">Hank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\n</span>\n<p class="style187">Why do it?</p>\n<span class="style162">George Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification. </span>\n\n<span class="style162">Henri </span><span class="style128">Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\n</span>\n<p class="style119">Whither the tech?</p>\n<span class="style128">Discussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work.</span><span class="style162"> On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\n</span>\n<p class="style187">Reversing extinction vs. preventing extinction</p>\n<span class="style162">In discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”</span>\n\n<span class="style162">Which extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\n</span>\n<p class="style187">More on restoring ecosystems</p>\n<span class="style162">During discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”</span>\n<p class="style187">Next steps</p>\n<span class="style162">In the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there </span><span class="style191">will</span><span class="style184"> be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“</span>\n\n<span class="style184">William Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\n</span>\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • </span><span class="style183">Ross MacPhee</span><span class="style184"> had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”</span></p>\n<span class="style184">Stewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<p class="style188">=======</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p class="f-lp"><span class="style184">(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects.  Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style121">Toward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion.  After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:</span></p>\n						<ul>\n							<li><span class="style121"> De-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.<br>&nbsp;</span></li>\n							<li><span class="style121">  It''s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.<br>&nbsp;</span></li>\n							<li><span class="style121"> Research on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.<br>&nbsp;</span></li>\n							<li><span class="style121"> Mutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.<br>&nbsp;</span></li>\n							<li><span class="style121"> Priority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential &quot;before the train leaves the station&quot; and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.<br>&nbsp;</span></li>\n							<li><span class="style121"> De-extinction is certain to be controversial for some. <br>&nbsp;</span></li>\n							<li><span class="style121"> To deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge): <br>&nbsp;</span>\n							<ul type=disc>\n								<li><span class="style121"> well-planned dialogue with key &quot;stakeholders&quot; (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.) <br>&nbsp;</span></li>\n								<li><span class="style121"> regular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue <br>&nbsp;</span></li>\n							</ul>\n							</li>\n							<li><span class="style121"> This level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.</span></li>\n						</ul>\n						<p><span class="style121">To open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever.  “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past.  In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.”  On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style119">Successes with cloning</p>\n						<p class="style194"><span class="style125"> •  To begin the first session, </span><span class="style181">Alberto Fernández-Arias</span><span class="style182"> reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex.  In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild.  In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree.  Bucardos were extinct.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style182">In 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats.  The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats.  One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section.  Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style182">Unfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments.  Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003.  Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style182"> •  The Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species.  </span><span class="style181">Oliver Ryder</span><span class="style182"> said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style182">The Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus.  With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species.  A hundred species have already been sequenced.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style182">Now that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species.  With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill. </span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style182"> •  </span><span class="style181">Robert Lanza</span><span class="style182"> focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells.  Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.  </span></p>\n						<p><span class="style182">Thirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs.  A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery.  Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style182">As for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.”  But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA.  Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny.  “This is the way we will probably go forward.”<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style119">Some projects underway</p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style125"> •  The aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said </span><span class="style183">Henri Kerkdijk-Otten</span><span class="style184">.  It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627.  As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">The species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe.  Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc..  Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available.  The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.”  Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.”  The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">The project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife.  The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  The most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project.  </span><span class="style183">Insung Hwang</span><span class="style184"> gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record.  No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184">•  Also off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species.  </span><span class="style183">Michael Archer</span><span class="style184"> and </span><span class="style183">David French</span><span class="style184"> described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer.  Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184">  •  One reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, </span><span class="style183">Michael Archer</span><span class="style184"> explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine.  While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.     </span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">If the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184">•  One remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by </span><span class="style183">Marilyn Renfree</span><span class="style185">.  </span><span class="style184">The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus.  A regulatory gene for cartilage formation</span><span class="style185"> (Col2a1</span><span class="style186">) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.  </span></p>\n						<p><span class="style186">One of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936.  The animals were so full of wolfish life!  David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth. <br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style187">Emerging genomic techniques</p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> •  </span><span class="style183">George Church</span><span class="style184"> began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law.  Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X.  (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.)  Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">Church’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously.  You can test what you get  in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism.  With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  Revive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by </span><span class="style183">Ben Novak</span><span class="style184">.  Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others.  Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed.  It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly.  Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon.  The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage.  Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon).  To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  According to </span><span class="style183">Michael McGrew</span><span class="style184">, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells.  His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck!  That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile.  The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents.  The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well.  The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  Noting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential,</span><span class="style183"> Jean-Marie Rouillard</span><span class="style184"> said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides.  Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million.  Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies.  Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.  </span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  The world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI).  Only started in 1999, </span><span class="style181">Guojie Zhang</span><span class="style182"> noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day.  The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes.  Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more.  Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes.  Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax.  BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style187"> Interpreting extinct molecules</p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> •  DNA is a fragile molecule, said </span><span class="style183">Tom Gilbert</span><span class="style184">, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation.  The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years.  Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences.  (“Introns are harder than codons.”)</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  No DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but </span><span class="style183">Mary Schweitzer</span><span class="style184"> showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.  </span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  As an alternative to PCR techniques, said </span><span class="style183">Michi Hofreiter</span><span class="style184">, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation.  It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  Studying mammoth ancient DNA, </span><span class="style183">Hendrik Poinar</span><span class="style184"> explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia.  They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African.  Like modern elephants they probably educated their young.  The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia.  To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style187">Reviving extinct ecosystems</p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> •  Vast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said </span><span class="style183">Sergey Zimov</span><span class="style184">, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna.  He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest.  Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">Zimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe.  He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison.  Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">Zimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth.  “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks.  Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  </span><span class="style183">Frans Vera</span><span class="style184"> also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape.  People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored.  A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest.  The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses.  As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">Huge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve.  In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation.  It comes down to who survives the winter.  The public would not accept watching animals starve.  So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter.  The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  The use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in </span><span class="style183">David Burney</span><span class="style184">’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai.  A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years.  Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground.  One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">Hundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants.  Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone.  Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there.  To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi.  They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">Burney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos).  You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).  </span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> •  America’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950.  </span><span class="style189">William Powell</span><span class="style186"> explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans.  Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature.  So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut.  Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style186">Powell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990.  They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid.  There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid.  When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted.  Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival.  Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree.  His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style195 f-lp">[Continued next column]</p>\n						</td>\n						<td width=4 height=5628 bgcolor="#ffffff" style="background-image:url(Resources/item4c.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n					</tr>\n					<tr valign=top>\n						<td width=4 height=4 bgcolor="#ffffff" style="background-image:url(Resources/item4e.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n						<td width=482 height=4 bgcolor="#ffffff" style="background-image:url(Resources/item4a.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n						<td width=4 height=4 bgcolor="#ffffff" style="background-image:url(Resources/item4f.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n					</tr>\n				</table>\n			</td>\n			<td height=117 colspan=3></td>\n			<td height=117>\n				<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=312>\n					<colgroup>\n						<col width=14>\n						<col width=284>\n						<col width=14>\n					</colgroup>\n					<tr valign=top>\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n						<td width=284 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2a.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2b.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n					</tr>\n					<tr valign=top>\n						<td width=14 height=89 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2c.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n						<td width=284 height=89 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2fd.png)"><p class="style132 f-lp"><strong>FORWARD TO THE PAST</strong><span class="style71"><strong><span class="style40"><br>Links</span></strong><br></span><span class="style5"><a href="octbios.html">Participant bio‘s</a> <br><a href="octreading.html">Recommended reading</a> <br>The  <a href="ppworshop.html">passenger pigeon meeting </a> at Harvard</span></p>\n						</td>\n						<td width=14 height=89 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2c.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n					</tr>\n					<tr valign=top>\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2d.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n						<td width=284 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2a.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2e.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n					</tr>\n				</table>\n			</td>\n			<td height=117></td>\n			<td height=117></td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr valign=top>\n			<td height=13 colspan=5></td>\n			<td height=13></td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr valign=top>\n			<td height=1556></td>\n			<td height=1556 colspan=4>\n				<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=489>\n					<colgroup>\n						<col width=14>\n						<col width=461>\n						<col width=14>\n					</colgroup>\n					<tr valign=top>\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/questions1.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n						<td width=461 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/questions1a.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/questions1b.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n					</tr>\n					<tr valign=top>\n						<td width=14 height=1528 style="background-image:url(Resources/questions1c.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\n						<td width=461 height=1528 style="background-image:url(Resources/questions1d.png)"><p class="style74"><span class="style5"><strong><span class="style144"><br><br><span class="style40">Participants</span></span></strong></span></p>\n						<p class="style143 f-lp"><strong>Michael Archer</strong>, Professor Biological, Earth &amp;

The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs.  The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style165">Nature</span><span class="style168"> magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas.  An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?”  Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.”  Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet.  Rewilding has begun nevertheless.  Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska.  Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?” </span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style150"> •  </span><span class="style189">Kate Jones</span><span class="style186"> said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones.  She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back.  Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts.  (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria.

De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.”  As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding.  A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation.  We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> •  </span><span class="style189">Stanley Temple</span><span class="style186"> said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement.  It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.”  He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.”  Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species.  Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected.  Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated. </span></p>\n						<p><span class="style186">In the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.”  Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully.  He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years.  Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people.  They </span><span class="style190">want</span><span class="style186"> the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo.  “Remember that zoos support conservation programs.  You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style187">De-extinction ethics</p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> •  The “ethics panel,” </span><span class="style183">Hank Greely</span><span class="style184"> pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications.  </span><span class="style183">Hillary Bok</span><span class="style184"> urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals.  </span><span class="style183">Alejandro Camacho</span><span class="style184"> said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.  A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife.  Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited. </span></p>\n						<p><span class="style183">Jacob Sherkow</span><span class="style184"> raised the question of patenting revived species.  He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it?  You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly.  </span><span class="style183">Nathan Wolfe</span><span class="style184"> suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue.  “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again.  It’s very low probability, but high impact.“  Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants.  You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">Hank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state.  The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style187">Why do it?</p>\n						<p><span class="style162">George Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction.  Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death.  “It is overcoming death’s finality.  It is reversing the irreversible.“  David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced.  “This is a new subject for us to explore.  We’ll learn a ton of stuff.”  Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe.  Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations.  Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.  </span></p>\n						<p><span class="style162">Henri </span><span class="style128">Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple.  It’s undoing damage that we have done.”  Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times.  “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“  Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement.  Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications.  We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style119">Whither the tech?</p>\n						<p><span class="style128">Discussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology.  Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal.  Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work.</span><span class="style162">  On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications.  We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style187">Reversing extinction vs. preventing extinction</p>\n						<p><span class="style162">In discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap.  Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back.  Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix.  Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct.  But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos.  De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability.  Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style162">Which extinct species should have the highest priority for revival?  Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation.  Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination).  Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style187">More on restoring ecosystems</p>\n						<p><span class="style162">During discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love.  When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest.  People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“  (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.)  David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear.  “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche.  We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores.  We don’t really need them.”</span></p>\n						<p class="style187">Next steps</p>\n						<p><span class="style162">In the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there </span><span class="style191">will</span><span class="style184"> be attacks.  He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world.  “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘  It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons.  There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">William Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project.  The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members.  They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him.  “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.”  Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.  <br>&nbsp;</span></p>\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  </span><span class="style183">Ross MacPhee</span><span class="style184"> had some concluding remarks.  As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.”  It fires their imagination.   Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality.  If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures.  The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination.  “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”</span></p>\n						<p><span class="style184">Stewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.”  The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable.  Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents.  “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries.  Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process.  I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”</span></p>\n						<p>&nbsp;</p>\n						<p class="style188">      =======</p>\n						<p>&nbsp;</p>\n						<p class="f-lp"><span class="style184">(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.”  On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style119">Successes with cloning</p>\r\n						<p class="style194"><span class="style125"> •  To begin the first session, </span><span class="style181">Alberto Fernández-Arias</span><span class="style182"> reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex.  In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild.  In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree.  Bucardos were extinct.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style182">In 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats.  The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats.  One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section.  Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style182">Unfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments.  Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003.  Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style182"> •  The Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species.  </span><span class="style181">Oliver Ryder</span><span class="style182"> said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style182">The Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus.  With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species.  A hundred species have already been sequenced.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style182">Now that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species.  With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill. </span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style182"> •  </span><span class="style181">Robert Lanza</span><span class="style182"> focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells.  Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome.  </span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style182">Thirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs.  A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery.  Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style182">As for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.”  But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA.  Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny.  “This is the way we will probably go forward.”<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style119">Some projects underway</p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style125"> •  The aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said </span><span class="style183">Henri Kerkdijk-Otten</span><span class="style184">.  It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627.  As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">The species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe.  Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc..  Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available.  The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.”  Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.”  The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">The project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife.  The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  The most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project.  </span><span class="style183">Insung Hwang</span><span class="style184"> gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record.  No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184">•  Also off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species.  </span><span class="style183">Michael Archer</span><span class="style184"> and </span><span class="style183">David French</span><span class="style184"> described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer.  Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184">  •  One reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, </span><span class="style183">Michael Archer</span><span class="style184"> explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine.  While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement.     </span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">If the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184">•  One remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by </span><span class="style183">Marilyn Renfree</span><span class="style185">.  </span><span class="style184">The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus.  A regulatory gene for cartilage formation</span><span class="style185"> (Col2a1</span><span class="style186">) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal.  </span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style186">One of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936.  The animals were so full of wolfish life!  David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth. <br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style187">Emerging genomic techniques</p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> •  </span><span class="style183">George Church</span><span class="style184"> began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law.  Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X.  (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.)  Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">Church’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously.  You can test what you get  in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism.  With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  Revive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by </span><span class="style183">Ben Novak</span><span class="style184">.  Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others.  Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed.  It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly.  Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon.  The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage.  Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon).  To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  According to </span><span class="style183">Michael McGrew</span><span class="style184">, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells.  His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck!  That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile.  The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents.  The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well.  The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  Noting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential,</span><span class="style183"> Jean-Marie Rouillard</span><span class="style184"> said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides.  Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million.  Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies.  Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity.  </span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  The world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI).  Only started in 1999, </span><span class="style181">Guojie Zhang</span><span class="style182"> noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day.  The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes.  Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more.  Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes.  Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax.  BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style187"> Interpreting extinct molecules</p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> •  DNA is a fragile molecule, said </span><span class="style183">Tom Gilbert</span><span class="style184">, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation.  The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years.  Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences.  (“Introns are harder than codons.”)</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  No DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but </span><span class="style183">Mary Schweitzer</span><span class="style184"> showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones.  </span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  As an alternative to PCR techniques, said </span><span class="style183">Michi Hofreiter</span><span class="style184">, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation.  It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  Studying mammoth ancient DNA, </span><span class="style183">Hendrik Poinar</span><span class="style184"> explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia.  They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African.  Like modern elephants they probably educated their young.  The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia.  To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style187">Reviving extinct ecosystems</p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> •  Vast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said </span><span class="style183">Sergey Zimov</span><span class="style184">, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna.  He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest.  Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">Zimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe.  He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison.  Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">Zimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth.  “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks.  Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  </span><span class="style183">Frans Vera</span><span class="style184"> also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape.  People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored.  A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest.  The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses.  As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">Huge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve.  In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation.  It comes down to who survives the winter.  The public would not accept watching animals starve.  So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter.  The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  The use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in </span><span class="style183">David Burney</span><span class="style184">’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai.  A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years.  Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground.  One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">Hundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants.  Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone.  Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there.  To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi.  They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">Burney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos).  You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago).  </span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> •  America’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950.  </span><span class="style189">William Powell</span><span class="style186"> explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans.  Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature.  So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut.  Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style186">Powell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990.  They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid.  There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid.  When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted.  Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival.  Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree.  His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style195 f-lp">[Continued next column]</p>\r\n						</td>\r\n						<td width=4 height=5628 bgcolor="#ffffff" style="background-image:url(Resources/item4c.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n					<tr valign=top>\r\n						<td width=4 height=4 bgcolor="#ffffff" style="background-image:url(Resources/item4e.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n						<td width=482 height=4 bgcolor="#ffffff" style="background-image:url(Resources/item4a.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n						<td width=4 height=4 bgcolor="#ffffff" style="background-image:url(Resources/item4f.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n				</table>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td height=117 colspan=3></td>\r\n			<td height=117>\r\n				<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=312>\r\n					<colgroup>\r\n						<col width=14>\r\n						<col width=284>\r\n						<col width=14>\r\n					</colgroup>\r\n					<tr valign=top>\r\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n						<td width=284 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2a.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2b.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n					<tr valign=top>\r\n						<td width=14 height=89 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2c.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n						<td width=284 height=89 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2fd.png)"><p class="style132 f-lp"><strong>FORWARD TO THE PAST</strong><span class="style71"><strong><span class="style40"><br>Links</span></strong><br></span><span class="style5"><a href="octbios.html">Participant bio‘s</a> <br><a href="octreading.html">Recommended reading</a> <br>The  <a href="ppworshop.html">passenger pigeon meeting </a> at Harvard</span></p>\r\n						</td>\r\n						<td width=14 height=89 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2c.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n					<tr valign=top>\r\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2d.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n						<td width=284 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2a.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/item2e.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n				</table>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td height=117></td>\r\n			<td height=117></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr valign=top>\r\n			<td height=13 colspan=5></td>\r\n			<td height=13></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr valign=top>\r\n			<td height=1556></td>\r\n			<td height=1556 colspan=4>\r\n				<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=489>\r\n					<colgroup>\r\n						<col width=14>\r\n						<col width=461>\r\n						<col width=14>\r\n					</colgroup>\r\n					<tr valign=top>\r\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/questions1.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n						<td width=461 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/questions1a.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n						<td width=14 height=14 style="background-image:url(Resources/questions1b.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n					</tr>\r\n					<tr valign=top>\r\n						<td width=14 height=1528 style="background-image:url(Resources/questions1c.png)"><img src="Resources/_clear.gif" border=0 width=1 height=1 alt="" style="float:left"></td>\r\n						<td width=461 height=1528 style="background-image:url(Resources/questions1d.png)"><p class="style74"><span class="style5"><strong><span class="style144"><br><br><span class="style40">Participants</span></span></strong></span></p>\r\n						<p class="style143 f-lp"><strong>Michael Archer</strong>, Professor Biological, Earth &amp;

The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs.  The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style165">Nature</span><span class="style168"> magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas.  An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?”  Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.”  Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet.  Rewilding has begun nevertheless.  Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska.  Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?” </span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style150"> •  </span><span class="style189">Kate Jones</span><span class="style186"> said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones.  She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back.  Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts.  (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria.  The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> •  </span><span class="style189">Peter Kareiva</span><span class="style186"> noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that.  The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation?  De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.”  As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding.  A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation.  We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> •  </span><span class="style189">Stanley Temple</span><span class="style186"> said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement.  It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.”  He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.”  Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species.  Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected.  Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated. </span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style186">In the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.”  Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully.  He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years.  Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people.  They </span><span class="style190">want</span><span class="style186"> the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo.  “Remember that zoos support conservation programs.  You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style187">De-extinction ethics</p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> •  The “ethics panel,” </span><span class="style183">Hank Greely</span><span class="style184"> pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications.  </span><span class="style183">Hillary Bok</span><span class="style184"> urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals.  </span><span class="style183">Alejandro Camacho</span><span class="style184"> said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.  A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife.  Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited. </span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style183">Jacob Sherkow</span><span class="style184"> raised the question of patenting revived species.  He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it?  You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly.  </span><span class="style183">Nathan Wolfe</span><span class="style184"> suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue.  “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again.  It’s very low probability, but high impact.“  Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants.  You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">Hank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state.  The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style187">Why do it?</p>\r\n						<p><span class="style162">George Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction.  Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death.  “It is overcoming death’s finality.  It is reversing the irreversible.“  David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced.  “This is a new subject for us to explore.  We’ll learn a ton of stuff.”  Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe.  Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations.  Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification.  </span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style162">Henri </span><span class="style128">Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple.  It’s undoing damage that we have done.”  Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times.  “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“  Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement.  Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications.  We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style119">Whither the tech?</p>\r\n						<p><span class="style128">Discussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology.  Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal.  Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work.</span><span class="style162">  On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications.  We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style187">Reversing extinction vs. preventing extinction</p>\r\n						<p><span class="style162">In discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap.  Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back.  Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix.  Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct.  But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos.  De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability.  Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style162">Which extinct species should have the highest priority for revival?  Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation.  Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination).  Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style187">More on restoring ecosystems</p>\r\n						<p><span class="style162">During discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love.  When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest.  People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“  (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.)  David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear.  “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche.  We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores.  We don’t really need them.”</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style187">Next steps</p>\r\n						<p><span class="style162">In the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there </span><span class="style191">will</span><span class="style184"> be attacks.  He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world.  “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘  It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons.  There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">William Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project.  The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members.  They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him.  “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.”  Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.  <br>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n						<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> •  </span><span class="style183">Ross MacPhee</span><span class="style184"> had some concluding remarks.  As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.”  It fires their imagination.   Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality.  If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures.  The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination.  “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”</span></p>\r\n						<p><span class="style184">Stewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.”  The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable.  Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents.  “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries.  Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process.  I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”</span></p>\r\n						<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n						<p class="style188">      =======</p>\r\n						<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n						<p class="f-lp"><span class="style184">(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

During my D.Phil (Oxford) my work focused on the challenges arising due to the problems of sample contamination, DNA degradation, and ensuring optimal extraction of nucleic acids from such material. In subsequent positions I have developed on these studies, in recent years coupling them with second-generation sequencing techniques, in order to help move ancient DNA analyses into the ''genomic'' era. My research group study a wide range of organisms, including viruses (e.g. HIV-1), plants (e.g. maize and grapes), giant (and other) squid, as well as birds and mammals. In the context of this workshop, I have been involved in research on the genetics of mammoths, woolly rhinos, moas and passenger pigeons, specifically with regards to phylogenetic and population genetic questions.<br><br><strong>Hank Greely</strong><br>Hank Greely is the Deane F. and Kate Edelman Johnson Professor of Law and Professor, by courtesy, of Genetics at Stanford University.

I remained at the MPI EVA, first as a postdoc and later as a research group leader until 2009 when I became Professor for Evolutionary Biology and Ecology at the University of York. My work has focused on the application of ancient DNA analyses to address questions in evolutionary biology ranging from phylogenetic studies over population genetics to studies investigating the genetic basis of adaptation and functional differences between extant and extinct species. I also lead the first functional genetics study using ancient DNA. While the initial studies in this field have investigated only a few or even single genes, in our latest projects we have started to use DNA hybridization capture technologies that allow studying dozens of complete gene sequences simultaneously.<br><br><strong>Insung Hwang</strong><br>- Researcher at Sooam Biotech Research Foundation<br>- Coordinator of Woolly Mammoth Restoration Project<br>- Started working for Sooam in 2010<br>- M.S. in biomedical engineering from Duke University in 2009<br>- B.S. in biomedical engineering from Yale University in 2008<br>- Involved projects at Sooam:<br>1.

Kate completed her PhD in 2008 in London and after fellowships at Imperial College London, University of Virginia and Columbia University, took up a permanent research post at Zoological Society of London in 2005 and then University College London in 2012. Her research examines how evolutionary processes generate global biodiversity patterns. This work has led to an understanding of the biological and anthropogenetic drivers of extinction in mammals and has generated some of the first predictive models of mammalian extinction. Kate&#8217;s work has also developed the first complete evolutionary tree of mammals which was used to create the first conservation prioritisation list based on evolutionary distinctiveness and global endangerment (<a href="http://www.edgeofexistence.org/">www.edgeofexistence.org</a>).

I became deeply interested in early embryogenesis so I joined an internationally recognised developmental biology laboratory in Marseille, France. We discovered an early mechanism controlling the timing of the formation of somites in vertebrates, now known as the &#8216;segmentation clock&#8217;. This is a basic biological process, which appears to be present in all vertebrate embryos. We also made many other key findings in our understanding of vertebrate segmentation during that period in which I played an important role. <br>I joined The Roslin Institute (Scotland) in 2001 to develop transgenesis in chickens. I realised the future of the chicken as a model system for developmental biology depended the development of new transgenic tools. My research led to the development of the first transgenic chickens using lentiviral vectors. Since that point I pursued the development of transgenic chicken models for uses in developmental biology and for studying stem cell populations. Since starting my own research group, my research interests have shifted towards a specialised stem cell; the germ cell. <br>We aim to:<br> -utilise avian germ cell technology to create frozen bio-banks<br> -apply this technology to species rescue using the germ cells of endangered birds<br><br><strong>Ben Novak</strong><br>I graduated from Montana State University as one of the first to enter and graduate from the Ecology and Evolution option. I specialized in paleontology, genetics, ecology and ornithology. I''ve been part of an assortment of projects involving identifying diagnostic SNP''s in trout populations, genetic diversity in prairie tiger salamanders, and analysis of biomolecules and bacteria found in dinosaur fossils. I finally broke into my desired field of ancient DNA at the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre, under Dr. Hendrik Poinar, gaining experience via exploring DNA extraction and sequencing of Mastodon fossils - the project now underway to be carried further by more researchers. Passenger pigeons and the possibility of de-extinction within the columbid family has been my passion, and I have pursued work with the species for the past 4 years, reaching my personal breakthrough recently. I am currently a prospective graduate student pursuing PhD programs to continue my de-extinction oriented work. &nbsp;My interests for the project include producing a database of extinct species information and genomes, using genetic mapping to calculate the needed process for de-extinction, and supplying this data for research groups around the world to produce as much pertaining knowledge as possible.<br><br><strong>Ryan Phelan</strong><br>Ryan Phelan is a serial entrepreneur active in both the for-profit and non-profit worlds.

I am also interested in the evolution of physiological and reproductive strategies in dinosaurs and their bird descendants. Were dinosaurs warm-blooded, cold-blooded or something in-between? And further afield, can we use the tools of molecular paleontology to detect biomarkers not only in fossils but also in extraterrestrial samples? Did life never evolve on other planets?

I became deeply interested in early embryogenesis so I joined an internationally recognised developmental biology laboratory in Marseille, France. We discovered an early mechanism controlling the timing of the formation of somites in vertebrates, now known as the &#8216;segmentation clock&#8217;. This is a basic biological process, which appears to be present in all vertebrate embryos. We also made many other key findings in our understanding of vertebrate segmentation during that period in which I played an important role. <br>I joined The Roslin Institute (Scotland) in 2001 to develop transgenesis in chickens. I realised the future of the chicken as a model system for developmental biology depended the development of new transgenic tools. My research led to the development of the first transgenic chickens using lentiviral vectors. Since that point I pursued the development of transgenic chicken models for uses in developmental biology and for studying stem cell populations. Since starting my own research group, my research interests have shifted towards a specialised stem cell; the germ cell. <br>We aim to:<br> -utilise avian germ cell technology to create frozen bio-banks<br> -apply this technology to species rescue using the germ cells of endangered birds<br><br><strong>Ben Novak</strong><br>I graduated from Montana State University as one of the first to enter and graduate from the Ecology and Evolution option.

I specialize in molecular paleontology by default, because when my children were small I found that small children and field research were incompatible.  My research areas of interest include: Preservation and detection of original molecular fragments in well preserved fossil specimens, what are the biogeochemical conditions that led to such preservation, and how best to use the data in fossils to address today&#8217;s questions.  I am also interested in the evolution of physiological and reproductive strategies in dinosaurs and their bird descendants. Were dinosaurs warm-blooded, cold-blooded or something in-between? And further afield, can we use the tools of molecular paleontology to detect biomarkers not only in fossils but also in extraterrestrial samples? Did life never evolve on other planets? Did it evolve then go extinct? Or is it thriving now<br><br><strong>Jacob Sherkow</strong><br>Jacob S. Sherkow is a Fellow at Stanford Law School in the Center for Law and the Biosciences.

There he wrote his Ph.D. thesis, which he finished back at the Ministry in 1997. It was published in an extended version in 2000 by CABI Publishing, Wallingford, as the book Grazing Ecology and Forest History. <br>It was the Oostvaardersplassen, in which he is involved since 1979, that made him question the classical paradigm that the undisturbed nature in Europe in places where trees can grow is a closed canopy forest. In natural conditions indigenous herbivores, such as Tarpan, Aurochs, European bison, Moose, Red Deer, Roe Deer and Wild Boar could not influence the succession to this climax, but followed it. He presented the alterative theory that in natural conditions they steered the succession, resulting in a kaleidoscope of grassland, shrubs, scrubs, trees and groves, of which the wood pasture system is the closest modern analogue.<br><br><strong>Nathan Wolfe</strong> <br>Dr. Nathan Wolfe is an epidemiologist who fights disease pandemics.

I became deeply interested in early embryogenesis so I joined an internationally recognised developmental biology laboratory in Marseille, France. We discovered an early mechanism controlling the timing of the formation of somites in vertebrates, now known as the &#8216;segmentation clock&#8217;. This is a basic biological process, which appears to be present in all vertebrate embryos. We also made many other key findings in our understanding of vertebrate segmentation during that period in which I played an important role. <br>I joined The Roslin Institute (Scotland) in 2001 to develop transgenesis in chickens. I realised the future of the chicken as a model system for developmental biology depended the development of new transgenic tools. My research led to the development of the first transgenic chickens using lentiviral vectors. Since that point I pursued the development of transgenic chicken models for uses in developmental biology and for studying stem cell populations. Since starting my own research group, my research interests have shifted towards a specialised stem cell; the germ cell. <br>We aim to:<br> -utilise avian germ cell technology to create frozen bio-banks<br> -apply this technology to species rescue using the germ cells of endangered birds<br><br><strong>Ben Novak</strong><br>I graduated from Montana State University as one of the first to enter and graduate from the Ecology and Evolution option. I specialized in paleontology, genetics, ecology and ornithology. I''ve been part of an assortment of projects involving identifying diagnostic SNP''s in trout populations, genetic diversity in prairie tiger salamanders, and analysis of biomolecules and bacteria found in dinosaur fossils. I finally broke into my desired field of ancient DNA at the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre, under Dr. Hendrik Poinar, gaining experience via exploring DNA extraction and sequencing of Mastodon fossils - the project now underway to be carried further by more researchers. Passenger pigeons and the possibility of de-extinction within the columbid family has been my passion, and I have pursued work with the species for the past 4 years, reaching my personal breakthrough recently. I am currently a prospective graduate student pursuing PhD programs to continue my de-extinction oriented work. &nbsp;My interests for the project include producing a database of extinct species information and genomes, using genetic mapping to calculate the needed process for de-extinction, and supplying this data for research groups around the world to produce as much pertaining knowledge as possible.<br><br><strong>Ryan Phelan</strong><br>Ryan Phelan is a serial entrepreneur active in both the for-profit and non-profit worlds.

I am also interested in the evolution of physiological and reproductive strategies in dinosaurs and their bird descendants. Were dinosaurs warm-blooded, cold-blooded or something in-between? And further afield, can we use the tools of molecular paleontology to detect biomarkers not only in fossils but also in extraterrestrial samples? Did life never evolve on other planets?

It would be a valuable tool for everyone working in ancient DNA. It could build off the list of "species to bring back". I''m thinking of a full list of extinct species within the age range that DNA is viable to retrieve, with some information on collections housing tissue or fossil material, taxonomy information, and some references to literature. In this way a person designing an ancient DNA project could find out what species have no previous DNA sequenced, what species do, and to what extent. With this list we can then append how suitable a species is for revival.” </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="larger center quiet"><a href="#top" class="nostyle quiet" style="color: #acb3af;"><i class="ss-icon" style="font-size: 1.3em; position: relative; top: 6px;">&#xF500;</i> Top of Page</a></p>\r\n', 'Home Page', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '7-revision-10', '', '', '2013-01-17 20:13:05', '2013-01-17 20:13:05', '', 7, 'http://rare.sansink.com/7-revision-10/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The costs and difficulty (maybe impossibility) are <em>vastly</em> greater for reversing extinction than for heading it off.

Technically one extinction has already been partially reversed.  The last Pyrenean ibex (also called a bucardo) died in 2000.  A Spanish team used frozen tissue to clone a living twin in 2003, birthed by a goat.  The baby ibex died of respiratory failure after seven minutes (a common problem in early cloning efforts).  Funding dried up, so no further work has been done on this species as yet.

It is one reason to do the research: <em>is</em> the genome the species?  The answer will vary from species to species.  De-extincted plants should flourish as if they&#8217;d never left, if suitable pollinators are still around.  But if California condors had gone extinct, it&#8217;s unclear if they could be brought back fully, because the young rely on parental training.  Passenger pigeons got no significant parental training, but can new ones function without a flock?  Could young mammoths be reared successfully by a herd of elephants?

Why do it? Why revive extinct species?</h2>\r\n\r\n    <p class="left-25">For the same reasons we protect endangered species. To preserve biodiveristy and genetic diversity. To undo harm that humans have caused in the past. To restore diminished ecosystems. To advance the science of preventing extinctions.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>2. Won’t reviving extinct species make people stop caring about protecting endangered species?</h2>\r\n\r\n    <p class="left-25">It is likely to make them care more. The costs and difficulty (maybe impossibility) are vastly greater for reversing extinction than for heading it off. Preventing extinction is hard enough; reversing extinction will be prohibitively expensive and maddeningly slow. In most cases, once a species is gone, it will stay gone. First protect the living.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>3. How soon will some extinct creature live again?</h2>\r\n\r\n    <p class="left-25">Signs are there will be some impressive milestones in this decade. Technically one extinction has already been partially reversed. The last Pyrenean ibex (also called a bucardo) died in 2000. A Spanish team used frozen tissue to clone a living twin in 2003, birthed by a goat. The baby ibex died of respiratory failure after seven minutes (a common problem in early cloning efforts). Funding dried up, so no further work has been done on this species as yet. As George Church reminds people, the first airplane flight in 1903 lasted 12 seconds.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <h2>4. If you bring the genome of a species back to life, are you really bringing the species back to life?</h2>\r\n    \r\n    <p class="left-25">That remains to be seen. It is one reason to do the research: is the genome the species? The answer will vary from species to species. De-extincted plants should flourish as if they’d never left, if suitable pollinators are still around. But if California condors had gone extinct, it’s unclear if they could be brought back fully, because the young rely on parental training. Passenger pigeons got no significant parental training, but can new ones function without a flock? Could young mammoths be reared successfully by a herd of elephants?

It would be a valuable tool for everyone working in ancient DNA. It could build off the list of "species to bring back". I''m thinking of a full list of extinct species within the age range that DNA is viable to retrieve, with some information on collections housing tissue or fossil material, taxonomy information, and some references to literature. In this way a person designing an ancient DNA project could find out what species have no previous DNA sequenced, what species do, and to what extent. With this list we can then append how suitable a species is for revival.” </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class="larger center quiet"><a href="#top" class="nostyle quiet" style="color: #acb3af;"><i class="ss-icon" style="font-size: 1.3em; position: relative; top: 6px;">&#xF500;</i> Top of Page</a></p>\r\n', 'Home Page', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '7-revision-11', '', '', '2013-01-17 20:16:14', '2013-01-17 20:16:14', '', 7, 'http://rare.sansink.com/7-revision-11/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In this way a person designing an ancient DNA project could find out what species have no previous DNA sequenced, what species do, and to what extent.

Why do it? Why revive extinct species?</h2>\r\n\r\n    <p class="left-25">For the same reasons we protect endangered species. To preserve biodiveristy and genetic diversity. To undo harm that humans have caused in the past. To restore diminished ecosystems. To advance the science of preventing extinctions.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>2. Won’t reviving extinct species make people stop caring about protecting endangered species?</h2>\r\n\r\n    <p class="left-25">It is likely to make them care more. The costs and difficulty (maybe impossibility) are vastly greater for reversing extinction than for heading it off. Preventing extinction is hard enough; reversing extinction will be prohibitively expensive and maddeningly slow. In most cases, once a species is gone, it will stay gone. First protect the living.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>3. How soon will some extinct creature live again?</h2>\r\n\r\n    <p class="left-25">Signs are there will be some impressive milestones in this decade. Technically one extinction has already been partially reversed. The last Pyrenean ibex (also called a bucardo) died in 2000. A Spanish team used frozen tissue to clone a living twin in 2003, birthed by a goat. The baby ibex died of respiratory failure after seven minutes (a common problem in early cloning efforts). Funding dried up, so no further work has been done on this species as yet. As George Church reminds people, the first airplane flight in 1903 lasted 12 seconds.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <h2>4. If you bring the genome of a species back to life, are you really bringing the species back to life?</h2>\r\n    \r\n    <p class="left-25">That remains to be seen. It is one reason to do the research: is the genome the species? The answer will vary from species to species. De-extincted plants should flourish as if they’d never left, if suitable pollinators are still around. But if California condors had gone extinct, it’s unclear if they could be brought back fully, because the young rely on parental training. Passenger pigeons got no significant parental training, but can new ones function without a flock? Could young mammoths be reared successfully by a herd of elephants? Once something is returned to the wild, how much does the wild teach it?</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class="span-9 last">\r\n    \r\n    <h1>Recommended reading</h1>\r\n\r\n    <p class="larger">EXTINCTION</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>NATURE’S GHOSTS: Confronting Extinction from the Age of Jefferson to the Age of Ecology</strong> - Mark V.

She died on September 1, 1914, at the Cincinnati Zoo. She was preserved in ice and sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, where she is occasionally displayed with a male (on right). Note the red eye, iridescent neck feathers, red feet, and (in the male) peach-colored breast and blueish back.\r\n\r\nBen Novak did grad work on ancient DNA at MacMaster University in Ontario, learned biotech skills at George Church''s lab in Boston, and will be working on passenger pigeon DNA and de-extinction in Beth Shapiro''s group at the University of California, Santa Cruz.', 'Species projects', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '33-revision-17', '', '', '2013-01-23 23:05:07', '2013-01-23 23:05:07', '', 33, 'http://rare.sansink.com/33-revision-17/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style121">Toward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> De-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> It''s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> Research on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> Mutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> Priority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> De-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> To deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul type="disc">\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> well-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> regular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> This level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span class="style121">To open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<p class="style119">Successes with cloning</p>\r\n<p class="style194"><span class="style125"> • To begin the first session, </span><span class="style181">Alberto Fernández-Arias</span><span class="style182"> reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style182">In 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style182">Unfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style182"> • The Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. </span><span class="style181">Oliver Ryder</span><span class="style182"> said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).</span></p>\r\n<span class="style182">The Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style182">Now that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill. </span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style182"> • </span><span class="style181">Robert Lanza</span><span class="style182"> focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome. </span></p>\r\n<span class="style182">Thirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style182">As for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style119">Some projects underway</p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style125"> • The aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said </span><span class="style183">Henri Kerkdijk-Otten</span><span class="style184">. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">The species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style184">The project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • The most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. </span><span class="style183">Insung Hwang</span><span class="style184"> gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184">• Also off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. </span><span class="style183">Michael Archer</span><span class="style184"> and </span><span class="style183">David French</span><span class="style184"> described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • One reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, </span><span class="style183">Michael Archer</span><span class="style184"> explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement. </span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">If the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184">• One remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by </span><span class="style183">Marilyn Renfree</span><span class="style185">. </span><span class="style184">The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation</span><span class="style185"> (Col2a1</span><span class="style186">) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal. </span></p>\r\n<span class="style186">One of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style187">Emerging genomic techniques</p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • </span><span class="style183">George Church</span><span class="style184"> began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">Church’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • Revive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by </span><span class="style183">Ben Novak</span><span class="style184">. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • According to </span><span class="style183">Michael McGrew</span><span class="style184">, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • Noting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential,</span><span class="style183"> Jean-Marie Rouillard</span><span class="style184"> said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity. </span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • The world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, </span><span class="style181">Guojie Zhang</span><span class="style182"> noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class="style187"> Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • DNA is a fragile molecule, said </span><span class="style183">Tom Gilbert</span><span class="style184">, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • No DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but </span><span class="style183">Mary Schweitzer</span><span class="style184"> showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones. </span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • As an alternative to PCR techniques, said </span><span class="style183">Michi Hofreiter</span><span class="style184">, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • Studying mammoth ancient DNA, </span><span class="style183">Hendrik Poinar</span><span class="style184"> explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class="style187">Reviving extinct ecosystems</p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • Vast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said </span><span class="style183">Sergey Zimov</span><span class="style184">, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">Zimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style184">Zimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • </span><span class="style183">Frans Vera</span><span class="style184"> also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">Huge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • The use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in </span><span class="style183">David Burney</span><span class="style184">’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">Hundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style184">Burney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago). </span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> • America’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. </span><span class="style189">William Powell</span><span class="style186"> explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style186">Powell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style195 f-lp">[Continued next column]</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4c.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="4" height="5628"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4e.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="4" height="4"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4a.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="482" height="4"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4f.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="4" height="4"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n<td colspan="3" height="117"></td>\r\n<td height="117">\r\n<table width="312" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><colgroup> <col width="14" /> <col width="284" /> <col width="14" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2a.png'');" width="284" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2b.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2c.png'');" width="14" height="89"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2fd.png'');" width="284" height="89">\r\n<p class="style132 f-lp"><strong>FORWARD TO THE PAST</strong><span class="style71"><strong><span class="style40">\r\nLinks</span></strong>\r\n</span><span class="style5"><a href="octbios.html">Participant bio‘s</a>\r\n<a href="octreading.html">Recommended reading</a>\r\nThe <a href="ppworshop.html">passenger pigeon meeting </a> at Harvard</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2c.png'');" width="14" height="89"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2d.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2a.png'');" width="284" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2e.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n<td height="117"></td>\r\n<td height="117"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td colspan="5" height="13"></td>\r\n<td height="13"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td height="1556"></td>\r\n<td colspan="4" height="1556">\r\n<table width="489" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><colgroup> <col width="14" /> <col width="461" /> <col width="14" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1a.png'');" width="461" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1b.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1c.png'');" width="14" height="1528"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1d.png'');" width="461" height="1528"><span class="style40">Participants</span>\r\n<p class="style143 f-lp"><strong>Michael Archer</strong>, Professor Biological, Earth &amp;

The idea was to restore ecosystems by replacing extinct keystone species with modern ecological surrogates—elephants for mammoths, Przewalski’s horse for the tarpan, African cheetahs for the old New World cheetahs. The project would go slowly over decades, starting with small species.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style165">Nature</span><span class="style168"> magazine put out a press release about lions and elephants in Kansas. An instant media frenzy led to headlines like “Who Wants a Pleistocene-Era Backyard?” Berger admitted, “We blew it in terms of media communications.” Controversy meant questions about credibility, and the project went quiet. Rewilding has begun nevertheless. Black-footed ferrets have been reintroduced; so has the Bolton tortoise; California condors; wolves; musk oxes in Alaska. Berger concluded, “Are we thinking about species per se, or are we thinking about ecologically functional relationships using keystones?” </span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style150"> • </span><span class="style189">Kate Jones</span><span class="style186"> said that early discussion with her colleagues at IUCN showed there is concern about funding being diverted from protecting endangered species to expensive efforts to revive extinct ones. She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> • </span><span class="style189">Peter Kareiva</span><span class="style186"> noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> • </span><span class="style189">Stanley Temple</span><span class="style186"> said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated. </span></p>\r\n<span class="style186">In the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They </span><span class="style190">want</span><span class="style186"> the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style187">De-extinction ethics</p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • The “ethics panel,” </span><span class="style183">Hank Greely</span><span class="style184"> pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. </span><span class="style183">Hillary Bok</span><span class="style184"> urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. </span><span class="style183">Alejandro Camacho</span><span class="style184"> said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited. </span></p>\r\n<span class="style183">Jacob Sherkow</span><span class="style184"> raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. </span><span class="style183">Nathan Wolfe</span><span class="style184"> suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style184">Hank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style187">Why do it?</p>\r\n<span class="style162">George Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification. </span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style162">Henri </span><span class="style128">Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style119">Whither the tech?</p>\r\n<span class="style128">Discussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work.</span><span class="style162"> On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style187">Reversing extinction vs. preventing extinction</p>\r\n<span class="style162">In discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style162">Which extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style187">More on restoring ecosystems</p>\r\n<span class="style162">During discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”</span>\r\n<p class="style187">Next steps</p>\r\n<span class="style162">In the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there </span><span class="style191">will</span><span class="style184"> be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style184">William Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • </span><span class="style183">Ross MacPhee</span><span class="style184"> had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">Stewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class="style188">=======</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class="f-lp"><span class="style184">(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

The idea was to bring together for the first time 36 scientists from around the world working on genomic techniques to revive extinct species, along with related projects. Molecular biology would meet conservation biology.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style121">Toward the end of the second day, Stanley Temple, one of the founders of conservation biology, was asked to draft a list of “points we agree on“ to reflect what the group had learned from 29 ten-minute presentations and a good deal of discussion. After further discussion, most of the group agreed with most of the following points for helping de-extinction proceed responsibly:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> De-extinction is exciting, moving forward, and will eventually be tried.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> It''s unlikely to happen very soon; we have time to do it right.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> Research on the enabling technologies should be encouraged, coordinated, and funded.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> Mutually beneficial linkages with other on-going endeavors (e.g., endangered species recovery, ecosystem restoration, and ex situ bio-banks) should be built.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> Priority-setting for targets and outcomes is essential "before the train leaves the station" and our discussions here have advanced the thought process.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> De-extinction is certain to be controversial for some.\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> To deal with anticipated obstacles there should be a pro-active lead-up to the day when de-extinction is attempted (i.e., building trust and knowledge):\r\n</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul type="disc">\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> well-planned dialogue with key "stakeholders" (private initiatives, interest groups, regulators, etc.)\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> regular, open conferences/symposia reporting on progress and providing a forum for serious dialogue\r\n</span></li>\r\n	<li><span class="style121"> This level of strategic planning requires considerable organizational capacity.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span class="style121">To open the first day, Terry Garcia, head of Missions at National Geographic, remarked that his organization expects this century to be the greatest period of exploration ever. “We are now able to open doors that seemed to be permanently closed to us in the past. In many cases the key to those doors is new technology.” On one of the most forbidding of the doors is written: “Extinction is forever.”\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<p class="style119">Successes with cloning</p>\r\n<p class="style194"><span class="style125"> • To begin the first session, </span><span class="style181">Alberto Fernández-Arias</span><span class="style182"> reported on a 2003 effort to clone an extinct subspecies of Spanish ibex, called the bucardo or Pyrenean ibex. In 1999 the last bucardo, a female named Celia, was captured from the wild in Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park, some tissue from her ear was cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, and she was returned to the wild. In 2000 she was found dead under a fallen tree. Bucardos were extinct.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style182">In 2003 a team led by Dr. José Folch attempted to clone Celia, transferring her DNA into enucleated eggs from domestic goats, then implanting the 3-to-6-cell embryos in surrogate mother goats. The most successful pregnancies were in hybrids developed from a cross between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. One pregnancy went all the way to term, and a baby bucardo was delivered by caesarean section. Genetic analysis showed it was a living member of the formerly extinct species.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style182">Unfortunately the baby bucardo lived for only ten minutes, succumbing to a malformed lung—respiration failure is a common problem in cloning experiments. Interspecies cloning has come a long way since 2003. Dr. Fernández-Arias expects new attempts will be made in the next few years to revive the bucardo and eventually return a sustainable population to the wild.</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style182"> • The Frozen Zoo, a project within the San Diego Zoo that has been running for 35 years, has cryopreserved samples (sperm, eggs, embryos, skin, etc.) from 10,000 individual animals in 1,000 vertebrate species. </span><span class="style181">Oliver Ryder</span><span class="style182"> said that samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used for hundreds of studies, and two endangered species have been cloned from the collection—the gaur and a banteng (by Robert Lanza).</span></p>\r\n<span class="style182">The Frozen Zoo is playing a crucial role in a major new initiative called “Genome 10K,” which aims to catalog full genome data for 10,000 vertebrate species—approximately one for every genus. With scientists and curators from institutions all over the world participating, Ryder expects this “ambitious and inspiring” project to enable reading the genetic heritage of all species. A hundred species have already been sequenced.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style182">Now that fibroblast cell cultures from skin can be used to make induced pluripotent stem cells, Ryder concluded, samples from the Frozen Zoo have been used to aid in the conservation of highly endangered species. With germ cells derived from the pluripotent stem cells, genetic variability and reproductive vigor could be restored to severely reduced species such as the northern white rhino and a primate called the drill. </span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style182"> • </span><span class="style181">Robert Lanza</span><span class="style182"> focussed on the new techniques that move beyond nuclear transfer to the use of cellular reprogramming to make induced pluripotent stem cells. Difficulties in working between species can be reduced when the living genome is as close as possible to the extinct genome. </span></p>\r\n<span class="style182">Thirteen years ago Lanza found that the genome of the domestic cow was close enough to the endangered gaur (also called “Indian bison“) that nuclear transfer could create gaur embryos in cow surrogate mothers, though the embryos had the mitochondrial cow DNA that came along with material in the enucleated cow eggs. A beautiful baby gaur resulted, but it died after two days of ordinary dysentery. Later, working with 25-year-old Frozen Zoo tissue from the endangered Javan banteng, the team again used cow eggs and this time got a healthy baby banteng that survived and prospered.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style182">As for extinct species, Lanza declared there is no hope of reviving dinosaurs because “You can’t clone from stone.” But there is hope with species where there is recoverable DNA. Just this year it has become possible with induced pluripotent stem cells to generate primordial germ cells that yield viable sperm and eggs that in turn yield viable progeny. “This is the way we will probably go forward.”\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style119">Some projects underway</p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style125"> • The aurochs once dominated Europe and northern Asia the way the American bison dominated North America, said </span><span class="style183">Henri Kerkdijk-Otten</span><span class="style184">. It was a huge ox, up to six feet high (1.85 meters) at the shoulder, extinct since 1627. As a megaherbivore it played a key role in maintaining Europe’s ancient mix of forest and grasslands.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">The species is being reconstructed by selective back-breeding of seven different hardy, primitive-looking cattle breeds that still live in Europe. Most of the work so far has focussed on selecting for the known phenotypic traits of the aurochs—size, color, hardiness, etc.. Genotype elements are being added as genetic information on the aurochs becomes available. The match does not have to be perfect to be “fit for purpose.” Kerkdijk-Otten noted that as rewilding proceeds and the nature reserve size goes from small to medium to large, the ethical dimension goes from “animal ethics” to “respect for potential wildness” to “eco-ethics.” The gradient is from animal welfare at one end to ecosystem health at the other.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style184">The project is run by the Tauros Foundation in the Netherlands, with the collaboration of 14 nations and working closely with Rewilding Europe and European Wildlife. The Megafauna Foundation plans similar programs for wild horses, the European water buffalo, and the Asiatic wild ass.</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • The most recent effort to clone the woolly mammoth by finding tissue with still-viable cells in the frozen tundra is a joint Russian/South Korean project. </span><span class="style183">Insung Hwang</span><span class="style184"> gave a report on early results from the group’s first expedition in Siberia but preferred to keep it off the record. No viable mammoth cells have been confirmed as yet.</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184">• Also off the record were early results from an Australian endeavor called Project Lazarus, which intends to revive a particularly exotic extinct species. </span><span class="style183">Michael Archer</span><span class="style184"> and </span><span class="style183">David French</span><span class="style184"> described the goals and techniques, mainly refinements of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Results to date have resulted in successful recovery of nuclei of the extinct species, introduction of these nuclei into the enucleated eggs of a living distant relative, fusion of the donor nucleus and host egg, and consequent development of embryos that have already progressed to the blastulae stage. DNA testing of the cells of these embryos indicates that they contain the DNA of the extinct species</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • One reason for the low profile of Project Lazarus, </span><span class="style183">Michael Archer</span><span class="style184"> explained, was his experience in being constantly pressured by the media in relation to a previous project he started in 2000 that was aimed at recovering and characterizing the DNA of the extinct thylacine (also known as the Tasmanian Wolf) from museum specimens, with the long-term goal, when technology caught up, of bringing back a live thylacine. While the DNA goals were all successful, the Project did not proceed after Archer’s term at the Australian Museum was up in 2003. It was at this time that he initiated the Lazarus Project, but deliberately without media involvement. </span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">If the thylacine can be brought back eventually, the Tasmanian wilderness is still suitable habitat, and the thylacine could resume its ecological role, perhaps even reducing the infectious cancer problem in Tasmanian devils since direct competition would spread them out.</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184">• One remarkable success with the thylacine genome was reported by </span><span class="style183">Marilyn Renfree</span><span class="style185">. </span><span class="style184">The team she worked with got a non-coding gene from the extinct animal to express in a mouse fetus. A regulatory gene for cartilage formation</span><span class="style185"> (Col2a1</span><span class="style186">) from thylacine DNA was injected into mouse zygotes and there performed the same function it did in the extinct animal. </span></p>\r\n<span class="style186">One of the most moving images of the workshop was historic film footage Renfree showed of thylacines pacing and jumping in their Hobart zoo pen—the last one died in 1936. The animals were so full of wolfish life! David Burney commented that the emotion we felt was just a tiny sample of what people will experience when they see a living mammoth.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style187">Emerging genomic techniques</p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • </span><span class="style183">George Church</span><span class="style184"> began by noting that since 2005, biotech capability (sequencing, DNA synthesis and assembly, and placement into stem cells) has been accelerating much faster than Moore’s Law. Costs are coming down every year by a factor of 6X to 11X. (Moore’s Law is 1.5X.) Church expects that within five years we will be able to make a dozen edits to a 3-billion-base-pair genome (size of many mammal and bird genomes) for $30,000 and synthesize 100 kbp (1,000 base pair) blocks for less than $10,000 each.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">Church’s lab at the Wyss Institute has a machine and protocol called MAGE—Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering—which allows DNA-directed or RNA-directed precise homologous recombination of multiple genes simultaneously. You can test what you get in cells or organs-on-a-chip before trying them on a complete organism. With the use of zinc finger nucleases, you can replace a gene in a living species with the equivalent gene from an extinct species precisely—right down to the individual base pair level.</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • Revive and Restore’s effort to bring back the passenger pigeon is being led by </span><span class="style183">Ben Novak</span><span class="style184">. Ancient DNA from museum specimens of passenger pigeons has been sequenced by Novak, Beth Shapiro, and others. Novak found that a pinhead-size piece of tissue such as a toe pad was all that was needed. It helps to sequence the genome of the closest living relative, in this case the band-tailed pigeon, to use as a reference sequence for getting better assembly. Novak‘s initial work on the band-tailed genome showed it to be 10 percent closer to the passenger pigeon than the rock pigeon. The hope is that George Church’s technique may be used to effectively transform the band-tailed pigeon into a passenger pigeon, stage by stage. Novak is confident it will eventually become possible to resurrect an extinct species even when all you have is tissue from a single specimen such as the dodo (another extinct pigeon). To head off inbreeding problems you may be able to borrow allelic variations from closely related living species.</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • According to </span><span class="style183">Michael McGrew</span><span class="style184">, birds are particularly manageable for working with primordial germ cells, because the germ cell lineage is separated early from somatic cells. His colleagues in Dubai got chicken germ cells to generate chicken sperm in a male duck! That chimeric duck mated with a chicken to produce normal chicken young, which were fertile. The same technique could be used with, say, germ cells induced from cryopreserved skin cells (fibroblasts) of an endangered falcon to produce pure falcon chicks from chicken parents. The process might work for reconstituted passenger pigeon germ cells as well. The use of chickens as a xenogenic host could also be a technique for avian preservation.</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • Noting that accuracy in DNA synthesis is both difficult and essential,</span><span class="style183"> Jean-Marie Rouillard</span><span class="style184"> said that his lab at MYcroarray gets around the problem with sorted libraries of error-free oligonucleotides. Some initial work suggests that assembling a 4 billion base pair mammoth genome might cost $125 million. Important problems that would have to be solved along the way include accurate chromosome assembly, epigenetics, heterozygosity, genome compatibility, and xenopregnancies. Solving those problems would help advance synthetic biology, including tools for gene therapy and enhancing biodiversity. </span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • The world leader in DNA sequencing is Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Only started in 1999, </span><span class="style181">Guojie Zhang</span><span class="style182"> noted, BGI’s multiple centers now process the equivalent of 3,000 human genomes a day. The institute has two major programs—one is human health; the other, called Tree of Life, is sequencing plant, animal, and microbial genomes. Working with Genome 10K, they have sequenced 120 vertebrates and are taking on 100 more. Another 207 species are planned to cover the full range of biota from primates to nematodes. Their work on ancient DNA has included analysis of a 4,000-year-old Eskimo that revealed he was balding, with brown eyes, type A blood, and dry ear wax. BGI is interested in working with efforts to study and revive extinct species.\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class="style187"> Interpreting extinct molecules\r\n\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • DNA is a fragile molecule, said </span><span class="style183">Tom Gilbert</span><span class="style184">, easily damaged by heat, water, oxygen, and radiation. The recent study of DNA in bones of the extinct moa suggests a half-life of 521 years. Ancient DNA samples typically have large quantities of contaminant DNA, some miscoding lesions, and an abundance of small fragments yielding reads that are too short for assembly—especially in regions of repetitive sequences. (“Introns are harder than codons.”)</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • No DNA has yet been recovered from dinosaur fossils, but </span><span class="style183">Mary Schweitzer</span><span class="style184"> showed evidence she has found ancient dinosaur proteins preserved in the remnants of osteocytes—bone cells—in their fossilized bones. </span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • As an alternative to PCR techniques, said </span><span class="style183">Michi Hofreiter</span><span class="style184">, hybridization capture offers a low-cost, high-throughput, contamination-tolerant way to target specific ancient DNA regions affecting physiological function. It is a shortcut to “functional paleogenetics,” yielding insights such as the degree to which mammoths had cold-adapted blood circulation. It can be applied efficiently to multiple specimens and can even span species that are not closely related.</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • Studying mammoth ancient DNA, </span><span class="style183">Hendrik Poinar</span><span class="style184"> explained, reveals that they were not all hairy, they varied regionally, and they hybridized during their declining millennia. They were forest dwellers, about the size of modern elephants, a closer cousin to Asian elephants than the African. Like modern elephants they probably educated their young. The last of them died out just 3,000 years ago, on Wrangel Island in the Arctic north of Siberia. To revive the mammoths will require developing abilities we don’t yet have to assemble and manipulate large chromosomes and to manage issues of epigentics and heterozygosity.\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class="style187">Reviving extinct ecosystems</p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • Vast Arctic grasslands called the mammoth steppe, said </span><span class="style183">Sergey Zimov</span><span class="style184">, once comprised the world’s largest biome, maintained by millions of herbivores with a density similar to the African savanna. He theorizes that the Pleistocene decline of megafauna in the north—caused mostly by human impacts—led to the steppe being replaced by tundra and boreal forest. Global warming is now being exacerbated by the thawing tundra permafrost releasing greenhouse gases.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">Zimov set about showing how the steppe grazing system and the steppe itself could be restored by creating a 62-square-mile “Pleistocene Park“ in northern Siberia, where a diverse array of herbivores (and some predators) could be fenced to establish the density that used to exist on the steppe. He began in 1988 with wild Yakutian horses, adding wild musk oxes, reindeer, and bison. Their grazing and trampling has succeeded in turning moss-choked tundra into ecologically rich grassland which is collecting carbon rather than releasing it.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style184">Zimov told the de-extinction workshop he would gladly populate Pleistocene Park with revived cave bears, cave hyenas, a grass-eating reindeer, some woolly rhinoceros, and of course the woolly mammoth. “To fight the forest, instead of mammoths we now use military tanks. Unfortunately they don’t create dung.”</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • </span><span class="style183">Frans Vera</span><span class="style184"> also emphasized the role of wild grazing animals in relation to the Oostvaardersplassen, a 23-square-mile nature reserve in the Netherlands which is recreating a version of the ancient European landscape. People wrongly assume that when abandoned farmland converts to closed-canopy forest, “nature” has been restored. A dense population of wild herbivores made Europe a far more biodiverse mix of grasslands and forest. The original aurochs and tarpan horses are gone, but they can be replaced by functional equivalents such as Heck cattle and Konik horses. As a result, the Oostvaardersplassen has attracted a full suite of endangered species, including graylag geese, bearded reedlings, and white-tailed eagles.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">Huge ethical issues emerge around how animals die in a public nature reserve. In nature, carrying capacity is not determined by predators so much as by starvation. It comes down to who survives the winter. The public would not accept watching animals starve. So the managers of the reserve shoot the clearly failing animals early in the winter. The way that is made acceptable is to have a veterinarian on hand when the animals are culled.</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • The use of ecological functional equivalents came up again in </span><span class="style183">David Burney</span><span class="style184">’s presentation on Hawaii’s Makauwahi Cave Reserve on the island of Kauai. A sinkhole at the site yielded paleoecology data covering the past 10,000 years. Clearly missing from the current bird fauna are mesoherbivores such as an extinct “tortoise-billed” flightless duck that specialized in eating plants close to the ground. One consequence of their absence is the way alien invasive plants carpet the Hawaiian islands.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">Hundreds of volunteers replanted the reserve with 6,000 native plants of 100 species, but they could not keep up with the relentless regrowth of the alien invasive plants. Burney took a cue from a reserve on Rodrigues Island where introduced land tortoises (alien but obligingly noninvasive) grazed the invasive plants aggressively and left the native plants alone. Land tortoises never reached the Hawaiian Islands; that’s why “tortoise-billed” birds evolved there. To serve as an “ecological surrogate,” African giant tortoises (Sulcata) that are widely kept as pets were brought in and tested at Makauwahi. They have proved to be brilliant weed-eaters, helping restore a living portion of ancient Kauai.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style184">Burney made the additional point that once you have good paleoecological data, you don’t have to feel limited to restoring endangered (or de-extincted) species in situ (where they were last seen living) or ex situ (in zoos). You might introduce them in a wider range of places that are “inter-situ” (where they used to live long ago). </span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> • America’s great eastern deciduous forest lost a quarter of its trees and a crucial keystone species when the billions of fully-grown American chestnut trees succumbed to an invasive fungus between 1909 and 1950. </span><span class="style189">William Powell</span><span class="style186"> explained that the huge annual mast production of palatable nuts fed countless animals (including extinct passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets) as well as humans. Not formally extinct, the trees live on at the root, but their shoots cannot mature. So great was the sense of loss that since 1983 The American Chestnut Foundation has been running an ambitious program to cross the American chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Now in their fourth generation of selective back-crossing, the trees are 15/16 American chestnut, are pretty resistant to the blight, and are being released gradually to repopulate the forest.</span></p>\r\n<span class="style186">Powell, working with Chuck Maynard, took a more biotech approach, starting in 1990. They observed that the blight cankers do their damage with oxalic acid. There is a gene in wheat that detoxifies oxalic acid. When that gene was engineered into the American chestnut, blight resistance resulted. Their transgenic trees are being incorporated into the American chestnut revival. Powell noted that the back-crossed American Chestnut has about 45,000 genes, some 2,800 (1/16th) of them from the Chinese tree. His transgenic American chestnut has only three to six genes that are new to the tree, and they are introduced with more precision.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style195 f-lp">[Continued next column]</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4c.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="4" height="5628"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4e.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="4" height="4"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4a.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="482" height="4"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item4f.png'');" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="4" height="4"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n<td colspan="3" height="117"></td>\r\n<td height="117">\r\n<table width="312" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><colgroup> <col width="14" /> <col width="284" /> <col width="14" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2a.png'');" width="284" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2b.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2c.png'');" width="14" height="89"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2fd.png'');" width="284" height="89">\r\n<p class="style132 f-lp"><strong>FORWARD TO THE PAST</strong><span class="style71"><strong><span class="style40">\r\nLinks</span></strong>\r\n</span><span class="style5"><a href="octbios.html">Participant bio‘s</a>\r\n<a href="octreading.html">Recommended reading</a>\r\nThe <a href="ppworshop.html">passenger pigeon meeting </a> at Harvard</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2c.png'');" width="14" height="89"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2d.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2a.png'');" width="284" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item2e.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n<td height="117"></td>\r\n<td height="117"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td colspan="5" height="13"></td>\r\n<td height="13"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td height="1556"></td>\r\n<td colspan="4" height="1556">\r\n<table width="489" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><colgroup> <col width="14" /> <col width="461" /> <col width="14" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1a.png'');" width="461" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1b.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1c.png'');" width="14" height="1528"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/questions1d.png'');" width="461" height="1528"><span class="style40">Participants</span>\r\n<p class="style143 f-lp"><strong>Michael Archer</strong>, Professor Biological, Earth &amp;

She herself has been converted to enthusiasm for de-extinction, she’s impressed by the technology, and she suggests that priorities carefully developed for selecting endangered species most worth protecting might also apply to selecting extinct species most worth bringing back. Criteria could include keystone qualities, ecological services provided, available habitat, and future climate impacts. (The website at edgeofexistence.org spells out the criteria. The acronym EDGE means “Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered.”)</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> • </span><span class="style189">Peter Kareiva</span><span class="style186"> noted that one of the threads in conservation is “awe and wonder,” and de-extinction can fit perfectly in that. The question to ask is: How can this play out well for conservation? De-extinction could help us shed nostalgia as a dominant theme in conservation and we could stop worrying about labels like “all natural.” As human population pressure starts to diminish in this century, there could be real opportunities for rewilding. A mosaic of nature and technology could be healthy for conservation. We need to proceed strategically—focus on iconic species and iconic ecosystems massively restored.</span></p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style186"> • </span><span class="style189">Stanley Temple</span><span class="style186"> said, “De-extinction is essentially a game-changer for the conservation biology movement. It changes one of our principal arguments, that extinction is forever.” He added, “There is much to be gained for endangered species recovery from de-extinction technologies, especially the very rare species that have lost their genetic diversity.” Likewise, rewilding methodologies developed for endangered species can be applied directly to rewilding extinct species. Species that went extinct for a single, correctable reason will have a better chance than most if that problem can be corrected. Be aware that any reintroduction of formerly extinct species will be very closely regulated. </span></p>\r\n<span class="style186">In the discussion that followed, Kareiva commented, “Putting together futurism with respect for species is something we have not done as a conservation community, and I see that as the only way the community is going to last and thrive.” Anticipating that rewilding revived species will be highly regulated, Temple advised familiarizing the regulators early, gradually, and thoughtfully. He recalled that getting permission to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone Park took 20 years. Ben Novak reminded the group about the widespread cool factor with de-extinction, especially for younger people. They </span><span class="style190">want</span><span class="style186"> the mammoth back, even if it’s in a zoo. “Remember that zoos support conservation programs. You get 10,000 extra visitors to see the mammoth, that’s a lot of money for conservation.”\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style187">De-extinction ethics</p>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style157"> • The “ethics panel,” </span><span class="style183">Hank Greely</span><span class="style184"> pointed out, was really about the full range of issues sometimes call ELSI—Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications. </span><span class="style183">Hillary Bok</span><span class="style184"> urged bearing in mind the welfare of the animals. </span><span class="style183">Alejandro Camacho</span><span class="style184"> said there are a wide range of laws affecting captive breeding and reintroducing species to the wild. These include the captive breeding regulations of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Animal Welfare Act, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. A different set of laws would apply and might restrict the introduction of any revived species. These include the ESA’s regulations on experimental populations, as well as the many different laws regulating the management of federal, state, and private lands and marine areas; invasive species; vulnerable and rare species; and other wildlife. Because these laws were created without anticipation of the distinctive issues raised by de-extinction, they are likely to apply to revival and reintroduction in anachronistic ways, and thus almost certainly should be revisited. </span></p>\r\n<span class="style183">Jacob Sherkow</span><span class="style184"> raised the question of patenting revived species. He thought it could be done legally, but why would you do it? You might do it defensively, to prevent others from carrying out revival irresponsibly. </span><span class="style183">Nathan Wolfe</span><span class="style184"> suggested that endogenous retroviruses, which reside in genomes, might become an issue. “Every once in a while they pop out and become exogenous again. It’s very low probability, but high impact.“ Some recombination between a mammoth endogenous retrovirus and an elephant exogenous retrovirus could be harmful to the mammoth or to other elephants. You could anticipate the problem with careful mapping and perhaps remove questionable retroviruses from the genome of the species being revived.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style184">Hank Greely noted that when a genetically engineered “GloFish” was introduced in the US in 2003, the Food and Drug Administration okayed it, but California’s Department of Fish and Game outlawed it in the state. The FDA usually gets involved only if the organism in question is eaten by humans.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style187">Why do it?</p>\r\n<span class="style162">George Church led a short discussion on what is most appealing about the prospect of de-extinction. Jamie Shreeve said the deep appeal is that it is a form of cheating death. “It is overcoming death’s finality. It is reversing the irreversible.“ David Burney observed that if de-extinction is technically possible, then it’s inevitable, so it might as well be embraced. “This is a new subject for us to explore. We’ll learn a ton of stuff.” Marilyn Renfree said that de-extinction can offer one more layer of backup for saving endangered species; it’s a form of fail-safe. Several people noted that de-extinction technology will provide ways to reintroduce genetic diversity to species that have dangerously small living populations. Michael Archer said that museum collections of preserved animal and plant specimens, maintained at great expense, now have a whole additional justification. </span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style162">Henri </span><span class="style128">Kerkdijk-Otten said, “For me it’s very simple. It’s undoing damage that we have done.” Stewart Brand drew a parallel with the first photographs of Earth from space, which replaced the mushroom cloud as the iconic image of our times. “It replaced an image of fear with an image of hope.“ Unexpectedly, the Earth photos set loose the modern environmental movement. Reviving extinct species will be hopeful news, much like the “Green List” of endangered species that are doing better being added to IUCN’s Red List publications. We can expect “unintended benefits” from de-extinction.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style119">Whither the tech?</p>\r\n<span class="style128">Discussion after lunch, led by Robert Lanza, focussed on next steps with de-extinction technology. Ryan Phelan suggested we could begin with mice, because they are such a well studied and tractable lab animal. Perhaps traits from an extinct mouse (such as Austalia’s long-tailed hopping mouse or Maclear’s rat) could be swapped into a lab mouse as proof that George Church’s homologous recombination technique can work.</span><span class="style162"> On the question of whether biotech capabilities will keep accelerating exponentially, Church noted that the field keeps being well funded because of its human medical applications. We could look for possible crossovers from de-extinction back into human medicine such as better ways to determine where pandemics come from, when wild-animal reservoirs are involved.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style187">Reversing extinction vs. preventing extinction</p>\r\n<span class="style162">In discussion led by Kate Jones about the relation between de-extinction and extinction-prevention (protecting endangered species), it became clear there are some areas of strong overlap. Criteria developed for selecting the endangered species most worth protecting can be applied to selecting the extinct species most worth bringing back. Likewise, protecting and restoring habitat for endangered species might become even more dramatic and fundable when formerly extinct species are added to the mix. Oliver Ryder pointed out that the northern white rhino, with only four non-mating animals still alive, is effectively extinct. But with his biobank of frozen tissues from a wider range of white rhinos, and perhaps even some alleles from the DNA of museum specimens, fertility and genetic diversity could be brought to the remaining rhinos. De-extinction techniques would help bring the severely endangered animals back to ongoing viability. Franz Vera noted, “Some endangered species remain endangered because their gene pool is too small.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style162">Which extinct species should have the highest priority for revival? Criteria that emerged from a brief discussion were divided into what is practical technically and what has the most interest for conservation. Current revival techniques require: 1) Recoverable ancient DNA or cryopreserved viable cells ; 2) Enough specimens for genetic diversity; and 3) A close living relative (for sequencing reference and potential homologous recombination). Conservation prefers: 1) Beloved species; 2) Keystone species, especially for a needed ecological function or as support for currently endangered species; 3) Evolutionarily distinct (rather than a minor sub-species); 4) Manageable for captive breeding; 5) Suitable habitat available; 6) Can’t do ecological harm; and 7) Removable if it does prove harmful.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style187">More on restoring ecosystems</p>\r\n<span class="style162">During discussion of restoring ecosystems, led by Joel Berger, William Powell observed that when you rewild a formerly extinct species, some people will worry about what it replaces, which might be some creature they know and love. When Powell’s American chestnuts take up their old role in the eastern US forest, they will transform some oak-hickory forest. People think the forests as they are now are just fine—a classic case of “shifting baseline.“ (Frans Vera commented that Europe has an even worse version of the same problem.) David Burney said that in terms of having a large predator to manage your herds of wild megaherbivores, the reality is you don’t need to revive the short-faced bear. “There are plenty of guys out there with high-powered rifles that are quite happy to occupy the short-faced bear niche. We can de-emphasize the big scary carnivores. We don’t really need them.”</span>\r\n<p class="style187">Next steps</p>\r\n<span class="style162">In the final discussion on public relations and next steps, Hank Greely pointed out that there </span><span class="style191">will</span><span class="style184"> be attacks. He was involved in the Human Genome Diversity Project to sample human DNA from around the world. “It quickly got tagged as ‘the vampire project.‘ It was accused of collecting samples for the CIA so the United States could make ethnic-specific biological weapons. There was a coalition of fourteen scientists from around the world who responded effectively in a timely way.“</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style184">William Powell told how essential it was for reviving the America chestnut to have a large lay membership supporting the project. The American Chestnut Foundation has 3,000 members. They volunteer for planting work, they contact their senators, they find and hire people like him. “Whatever organism you want to bring back, you need to have a group of dedicated people supporting you.” Kate Jones mentioned the importance of getting citizen-science groups involved in helping with the research.\r\n</span>\r\n<p class="style164"><span class="style184"> • </span><span class="style183">Ross MacPhee</span><span class="style184"> had some concluding remarks. As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York he‘s noticed that the public is fascinated by anything that might be referred to as “mythic creatures—unicorns, dragons.” It fires their imagination. Extinct animals such as mammoths have that quality. If he had an exhibition on de-extinction, people would bring that level of fascination to contemplating preserved specimens of extinct creatures. The thought of bringing those creatures back fires the imagination. “They will feel that it is a daring thing to do and the right thing to do.”</span></p>\r\n<span class="style184">Stewart Brand opined that it‘s appropriate to have the “Revive and Restore” project incubating within The Long Now Foundation, where the “long now” is defined as “the last 10,000 years and the next 10,000 years.” The last ten millennia is when most of the human-caused extinctions occurred, and yet DNA from those species remains readable. Undertaking to revive some of those creatures means engaging the time scale of species and habitats and continents. “It is not measured in years or decades, but at least in centuries. Reviving extinct species is a long, slow, gradual, exciting process. I love to see civilization stepping up that kind of thing.”</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class="style188">=======</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class="f-lp"><span class="style184">(The workshop was organized by Ryan Phelan, working with Jamie Shreeve and Stewart Brand, plus steering committee members Hank Greely, Hendrik Poinar, Ross MacPhee, and George Church.

 (Other candidates include the Carolina parakeet, heath hen, ivory-billed woodpecker, Labrador duck, great auk, and woolly mammoth.)</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">Stewart Brand suggested that the first campaign to bring back an extinct species will wind up framing, for good or ill, all subsequent attempts.  He proposed that the ultimate goal be “deep ecological enrichment through extinct species revival.”  Genetic technology is moving so rapidly that amateurs may be able to revive extinct genelines within decades.  It would be preferable to have a full set of publicly understood norms for proceeding responsibly in place by that time.  Ryan Phelan noted that experiments in de-extinction may also provide new scientific knowledge that could be applied to helping save endangered species.</span>\r\n\r\n<img style="vertical-align: baseline;" alt="IMG4921" src="Resources/img4921a.jpeg" width="459" height="346" border="0" />\r\n\r\n<img style="vertical-align: baseline;" alt="George Church and his “Multiplex" src="Resources/item4b.gif" width="450" height="40" border="0" /><span class="style57">\r\nGeorge Church began by saying that the technical capabilities of reading and writing genetic code are increasing eightfold every year, with costs also dropping exponentially, and that rate is holding steady.  We are now able to replace specific genes using “zinc finger nucleases,” even in extremely difficult genomes.  It’s a form of enhanced homologous recombination.  “You can make as little as one base pair change without touching the rest of the genome.”  In addition his lab has recently developed a technique called “Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering” (MAGE) that can engineer multiple changes over millions of base pairs by tricking replication.  “You can take a piece of DNA out of your favorite organism, move it into e. coli, make a lot of changes---five changes every three hours, and then take that big piece of DNA and move it back.  You can carefully craft the DNA in its normal place.”</span>\r\n\r\n<img style="float: left; margin: 7px;" alt="IMG4914a" src="Resources/img4914a.jpeg" width="276" height="397" border="0" /><span class="style57">The whole process is made easier by a device his lab built which writes and reads DNA.  It allows you to correct your results as you go along.  You can even note the effects on organisms on the slide and then select the ones you want.  For larger organisms, this form of “genome editing” can be tested on cells and tissues before you go for a whole bird.  There has already been some genome engineering with chickens, to make them resistant to avian influenza.  Working with primordial germ cells, <img style="float: left; margin: 7px;" alt="George Church’s “lab in a" src="Resources/item6a.gif" width="265" height="53" border="0" />you introduce the changes into the embryo in the egg---lots easier than trying to reach the embryo in a mammal.  (Also the genome is simpler.  Mice and humans have 3 billion base pairs; birds have 1.5 billion.)</span>\r\n\r\n<img style="float: left; margin: 7px;" alt="Bandtail1" src="Resources/bandtail1a.jpeg" width="244" height="322" border="0" /><img style="float: left; margin: 7px;" alt="Band-tailed pigeon" src="Resources/item4c.gif" width="242" height="28" border="0" /><span class="style57">The closest relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon (</span><span class="style53">Patagioenas fasciata</span><span class="style57">), which is common in the American west.  Church’s idea is to sequence both birds (there are hundreds of specimens of the passenger pigeon in museums), compare their genomes, and then gene by gene (trait by trait) transform the band-tailed genome into that of a passenger pigeon.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">For example, a passenger pigeon has a much longer tail than a band-tailed pigeon.  Once you’ve found the genome sequence that determines the tail length, you replace that sequence in the band-tailed pigeon with the tail-length sequence from the passenger pigeon.  You take, say, twelve changes you want---a few for tail size, a few for color (red eye, peach-colored breast), a few that are behavioral---check that each set works in separate birds and then breed them conventionally until you get all twelve in one bird.  “Identifying which genes to target may be the hardest part, especially the behavioral genes.”</span>\r\n\r\n<img style="float: left; margin: 7px;" alt="IMG4871a" src="Resources/img4871a.jpeg" width="240" height="461" border="0" /><img style="float: left; margin: 7px;" alt="Comparative tail lengths: passenger pigeon" src="Resources/item6b.gif" width="240" height="40" border="0" /><span class="style57">David Blockstein commented than in captivity some pigeons can go from egg to next generation egg in as short as six months. Scott Edwards wondered if twelve gene changes might get you 80% of the way to a passenger pigeon, but it could take a thousand more to get you all the way.  Beth Shapiro asked, “What is the threshold for making a species a species?”  Jamie Shreeve suggested the term “proxy passenger pigeon” for the initial reconstructed bird.  It would not yet be totally identical genomically to the original passenger pigeon but may embody its most significant characteristics.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">The group then went across a courtyard to the Wyss Institute to view Church’s spectacular hardware.  The first was the Polonator G007 from Dover, perched on a table like an airport-lounge coffee machine.  Church: “It’s basically a whole lab in a box.  You can read and write DNA.  You can do biochemistry.  You can do cell biology.”  In the next room was the current version of the MAGE</span></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3c.png'');" width="14" height="3387"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3e.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3a.png'');" width="466" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3f.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n<td colspan="2" height="2"></td>\r\n<td height="2"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td height="3413"></td>\r\n<td rowspan="2" height="3415">\r\n<table width="494" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><colgroup> <col width="14" /> <col width="466" /> <col width="14" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3a.png'');" width="466" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3b.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3c.png'');" width="14" height="3387"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3d.png'');" width="466" height="3387">\r\n<p class="f-fp"><span class="style57">machine, the size of a kitchen refrigerator on its side.  “You can make up to a billion genomes a day for combinatorial exploration.“</span></p>\r\n<span class="style57">What would be the cost these days of building a passenger pigeon genomically?  Church figured that if you did twelve strains in parallel, each with twelve mutations (constructs), you get 144 mutations.  It might cost $100,000 per strain to get it into the bird.  The whole process might take five years.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">Beth Shapiro reported on her experience sequencing “ancient DNA” from woolly mammoths, bison and horse bones, dodos, and passenger pigeons.  Along with DNA reads from the target species you get contamination from creatures in the soil, things that colonize the bone, from people, and from mysterious sources.  Of the reads they got from one well-preserved, frozen woolly mammoth, some 45% were “alignable” with current elephant DNA.  That’s considered very good.  What other groups got from Neanderthals was only 0.1% - 2% alignable with primates.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">The genetic reads she got from passenger pigeon specimens are in between---about 25%, which is plenty to work with.  Samples were taken from toe pads, the base of feathers, and muscle tissue, from nine specimens so far.  Her research has focussed on traces of historic population dynamics discoverable in the genomes of animals such as bison.  A reduction in genetic diversity would suggest that the population was getting smaller, potentially heading toward a bottleneck, and that crisis can be roughly dated.  Studying nine specimens of passenger pigeons from the Royal Ontario Museum showed that they had very high genetic diversity.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">She now has a great many short reads from the passenger pigeon genome, but they have yet to be mapped against a similar living genome.  Her group has been using the common rock pigeon.  A band-tailed pigeon would be better. Getting more DNA samples from more passenger pigeon specimens would help.  The goal is a complete and annotated genome.  The cost of their passenger pigeon work so far (“not including person time”) has been about $10,000.  The cost of thoroughly sequencing the band-tailed pigeon (there are some in captivity) might be about $60,000, Shapiro concluded. </span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">Any attempt to restore revived passenger pigeons to the wild will have to operate with good knowledge about what elements led to their extinction in the first place, because those elements must be anticipated and overcome this time around, or there’s little hope.  (It may be that 21st-century genomic analysis and attempts to rewild the bird have the side-benefit of revealing the true causes of the original extinction.)</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">David Blockstein probed the standard explanations of the precipitous decline of the bird population from billions to thousands in 25 years---massive hunting, habitat loss, mysterious disease---and he made the case for constrained reproduction.  The bird seemed to mate most successfully only in huge groups, and it laid a single egg on a flimsy, conspicuous nest.  Its ecological success may have depended too exclusively on “predator satiation”---overwhelming predators with sheer numbers---and when that was compromised, the rest of its defenses may have been too feeble.  “Once its population dropped below a certain level, the passenger pigeon may have been ecologically extinct long before the last birds died.”  </span>\r\n\r\n<img style="vertical-align: text-top; margin: 5px;" alt="imagelarge4a" src="Resources/imagelarge4a.jpeg" width="354" height="232" border="0" /><img style="vertical-align: baseline; margin: 5px;" alt="Passenger pigeon nest and customary" src="Resources/item4d.gif" width="295" height="29" border="0" /><span class="style57">\r\nJoel Greenberg argued that the literature indicates that there were many small groups who nested successfully.  Even more than with their overwhelming numbers, the pigeons evaded predators (including Indians) by roosting, nesting, and feeding in different places every year.  Once Americans had the telegraph to spread the word about where the birds were massing each year, that former advantage turned into the pigeon’s greatest vulnerability. </span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">Noel Snyder drew on his decades of experience saving the California condor (22 birds left in 1987; 400 alive now, half of them back in the wild) to consider potential problems with captive breeding and release to the wild of reconstructed passenger pigeons.  “Politics can often overwhelm everything else that you’re trying to do.”  California condors are still not safe in the wild because gun enthusiasts refuse to use non-lead bullets, and the condors keep being poisoned by lead in carcasses that hunters leave.  The very problem that caused the near extinction of the bird has not been corrected.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">Scott Edwards opined that the passenger pigeon may be a pretty good candidate for re-establishment in the wild.  It’s small enough to reproduce rapidly.  Being nomadic and irruptive (migrates in large numbers), it can find and occupy favorable habitats.  There are 309 species of pigeons, which suggests they adapt and speciate readily.  Much of the eastern deciduous forest has grown back since the 1880s, and commercial hunting has stopped.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">Hank Greely addressed “the ethical, legal, and social issues that this project might raise.”  He thinks that quite different issues will arise in its two phases---1) recreating the passenger pigeon and 2) releasing it into the wild.  The issues with the first phase should be minor. “Some will think it’s wrong because they think we’re playing God.  Others will think it’s wrong because they think we’re usurping the deity they call Nature.”  Visceral reactions like that could come from both left and right. But any potential ecological risks from recreating the species don’t matter so long as it is kept in a controlled environment.  Some will worry that if you can revive extinct species, then you undercut efforts to keep endangered species from going extinct.  (A similar argument was made against seat belts in cars---people will feel invulnerable and drive more dangerously.)  </span>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.joelsartore.com/stock/BIR033-00327/?search=passenger%20pigeon&amp;sequence=7&amp;num=100"><img style="float: right; margin: 7px;" alt="untitled1" src="Resources/untitled1.jpeg" width="273" height="462" border="0" /></a><img style="float: right; margin: 7px;" alt="The passenger pigeon’s famously alert," src="Resources/item4e.gif" usemap="#map2" width="271" height="50" border="0" /><span class="style57">Once you consider releasing the birds, now the question is, what are the risks?  The habitat the bird was once native to has been replaced by different forests and many more people.  Will it cause eco-disruption?  Could it be a disease vector?  You may get political opposition from farmers or from hunters.  Would the bird have to go through the exhaustive bureaucratic process that GMO crops face?  (Is it really a transgenic organism?  All its genes are pigeon genes, edited precisely.)  The Environmental Protection Agency would get involved, and Environmental Impact Reports would be required.  One advantage of recreating the bird genetically and breeding it in captivity for years is that you would gain a lot of information to help manage its reintroduction to the wild.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">Brand proposed that, as the project chugs along, the public will have years to comprehend and discuss the prospects of bringing back an extinct species.  “This generation gets to rethink extinction, gets to rethink habitat loss and habitat restoration, and gets to ponder the role of biotechnology in protecting biodiversity.  Welcome to a very interesting century.”</span>\r\n\r\n<span class="style57">The group finished by contemplating next steps.  Jamie Shreeve urged moving ahead on the proposed genetic technique to see if it works and how it can be improved.  Plans for a “Revive and Restore” conference in the Fall of 2012 were discussed---perhaps hosted by National Geographic, perhaps by Stanford. As for near-term public visibility of the proposed scheme to Bring Back the Passenger Pigeon (or other extinct species), the group agreed that everyone at the meeting should feel free to raise the subject with anyone while at the same time being careful to lower expectations.  The de-extinction idea is being explored; there are LOTS of reasons it may not work.</span>\r\n<p class="style58">--Stewart Brand (22 Feb 2012)</p>\r\n<p class="f-lp"><span class="style57"> Financial report:  The cost of the meeting was about $10,000, mostly for travel and lodging, and was provided by Ryan Phelan.  The meeting room we owe to Harvard Medical School.</span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3c.png'');" width="14" height="3387"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3e.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3a.png'');" width="466" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td style="background-image: url(''Resources/item3f.png'');" width="14" height="14"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n<td height="3413"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr valign="top">\r\n<td colspan="2" height="2"></td>\r\n<td height="2"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class="f-sp">\r\n<td><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="494" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="12" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="494" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n<td height="1"><img style="float: left;" alt="" src="Resources/_clear.gif" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>', 'Passenger Pigeon Workshop', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '36-revision-5', '', '', '2013-02-07 16:51:24', '2013-02-07 16:51:24', '', 36, 'http://rare.sansink.com/uncategorized/2013/36-revision-5/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
